00:01:03.712 --> 00:01:06.549
Do you
accept?

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:08.650
I'm not...

00:01:08.683 --> 00:01:10.986
Actually,
you don't have a choice.

00:01:15.891 --> 00:01:18.928
You're not a hero or a savior.

00:01:30.438 --> 00:01:32.074
This is my father.

00:01:33.641 --> 00:01:34.944
I know.

00:01:36.043 --> 00:01:37.045
And he was a failure.

00:02:23.057 --> 00:02:24.926
I feel
suffocated here.

00:02:28.062 --> 00:02:29.965
I can't wait to be in our
nation.

00:02:33.801 --> 00:02:36.138
The infidel's
polluted world gets worse.

00:02:39.074 --> 00:02:41.644
Your sacrifice will make you a
martyr.

00:02:42.176 --> 00:02:43.179
Will you do it?

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:45.080
I will.

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:12.140
Hey.

00:03:13.542 --> 00:03:14.544
Can you move the car?

00:03:20.782 --> 00:03:22.084
Oh, let me...

00:03:22.116 --> 00:03:25.020
Oh, look at this little thing.

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.061
Oh no!

00:06:16.158 --> 00:06:17.326
It's rigged.

00:06:18.392 --> 00:06:22.230
The whole damn system
is rigged against us.

00:06:29.771 --> 00:06:32.141
A month in prison for beating a
racist?

00:06:32.874 --> 00:06:34.310
Come on, America.

00:06:35.043 --> 00:06:36.312
Sharia does better justice.

00:06:37.713 --> 00:06:39.382
Pulling a Muslim's beard.

00:06:40.182 --> 00:06:41.317
He should be flogged in public.

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:49.225
Abid was right.

00:06:50.192 --> 00:06:51.694
When we occupy the White House

00:06:52.461 --> 00:06:54.697
it'll be by a true follower of
Sharia.

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:58.401
Insha Allah that day will come.

00:07:05.874 --> 00:07:06.676
Shalom.

00:07:10.512 --> 00:07:12.947
Kesselman, my co-worker,

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:14.182
he doesn't work on Saturdays.

00:07:15.483 --> 00:07:18.387
I am fine but shouldn't
I be treated the same?

00:07:19.286 --> 00:07:21.757
At work all I asked is five
brief...

00:07:29.531 --> 00:07:32.768
Five brief breaks to
pray and keep my faith.

00:07:33.435 --> 00:07:34.370
What's wrong with that?

00:07:37.773 --> 00:07:38.874
Hey!

00:07:38.906 --> 00:07:40.475
What the hell are you looking
at?

00:07:56.557 --> 00:07:57.959
Look at her.

00:08:04.966 --> 00:08:07.903
She's not like that because she
likes it.

00:08:07.935 --> 00:08:10.938
It's because someone
screwed her chance in life.

00:08:10.971 --> 00:08:11.940
What the hell!

00:08:13.108 --> 00:08:14.143
Watch where you're going!

00:08:15.944 --> 00:08:17.146
Wear hijab!

00:09:29.216 --> 00:09:30.251
What happened Babu?

00:09:31.019 --> 00:09:32.086
Nothing.

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:37.192
Listen.

00:09:37.225 --> 00:09:39.228
This country is melting pot.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.063
You have to adjust and adapt.

00:09:46.567 --> 00:09:48.937
Whatever the reason, I
don't want to melt in it.

00:09:54.975 --> 00:09:58.312
Look Faisal, you choose
your father's religion.

00:09:58.346 --> 00:09:59.581
No problem.

00:10:00.682 --> 00:10:03.552
Don't forget this is our country
now,

00:10:04.351 --> 00:10:06.087
all freedom for us.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.557
My country is where my father
is.

00:10:12.626 --> 00:10:13.895
So I'm right.

00:10:17.399 --> 00:10:19.567
You are watching stupid videos.

00:10:20.534 --> 00:10:22.069
I don't want to lie to you.

00:10:22.102 --> 00:10:23.572
Son, please.

00:10:23.605 --> 00:10:26.274
I've tried to forget all these
hatred.

00:10:27.408 --> 00:10:29.110
I can't.

00:10:29.144 --> 00:10:30.946
You are confused.

00:10:30.979 --> 00:10:32.413
It's not religion.

00:10:33.148 --> 00:10:35.117
It's people.

00:10:35.149 --> 00:10:36.485
People you are following.

00:10:41.022 --> 00:10:43.125
I've heard that many times.

00:10:48.429 --> 00:10:51.632
I've paid heavily for
marrying your father.

00:10:55.503 --> 00:10:58.574
Probably he's already dead.

00:11:02.143 --> 00:11:04.647
But still I can't see my family
now.

00:11:07.215 --> 00:11:08.951
He's following Allah's will.

00:11:11.318 --> 00:11:13.588
Look at young people around
you.

00:11:15.123 --> 00:11:18.427
They are happy, they are
working,

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:20.663
making money and enjoying life.

00:11:22.596 --> 00:11:24.298
I'm not them.

00:11:24.331 --> 00:11:25.200
I don't like them.

00:11:25.232 --> 00:11:27.101
I don't want to be like them,
period.

00:11:29.504 --> 00:11:30.605
Stop drinking.

00:11:30.638 --> 00:11:31.639
You look stupid.

00:11:33.008 --> 00:11:34.143
Hey!

00:11:34.775 --> 00:11:35.610
Don't talk like that!

00:11:36.443 --> 00:11:38.012
I'm your mother damn it!

00:11:45.186 --> 00:11:46.989
Hello Renu.

00:11:47.022 --> 00:11:48.524
Hello papa.

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:50.424
What is the time like there?

00:11:50.457 --> 00:11:52.360
Kathmandu is just waking up.

00:11:52.394 --> 00:11:54.196
It's serious papa.

00:11:55.029 --> 00:11:57.298
Bunty is brain washed.

00:11:57.331 --> 00:11:58.265
Send him to Kathmandu.

00:11:58.298 --> 00:12:00.034
He'll be fine.

00:12:00.067 --> 00:12:03.004
He want to find his father.

00:12:05.039 --> 00:12:06.140
Did you do it?

00:12:06.173 --> 00:12:07.208
Yes.

00:12:08.043 --> 00:12:09.711
I re-took the Shahada.

00:12:09.744 --> 00:12:11.046
You're a true
Muslim.

00:12:13.114 --> 00:12:14.416
How is he?

00:12:14.448 --> 00:12:15.650
Your father?

00:12:16.583 --> 00:12:18.386
He said to be careful in your
country.

00:12:18.419 --> 00:12:20.322
It's a detour only so that the
Americans

00:12:20.355 --> 00:12:22.157
don't become suspicious or
anything.

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:24.159
There's nothing in
Kathmandu that I cherish.

00:12:25.626 --> 00:12:28.062
Keep listening
to the song and keep fit.

00:12:28.763 --> 00:12:30.032
You have a lot to do here.

00:12:30.764 --> 00:12:32.735
- Good bye.
- Good bye.

00:14:32.953 --> 00:14:35.823
- Greetings!
- Greetings.

00:14:39.894 --> 00:14:41.462
Look at us!

00:14:41.495 --> 00:14:42.663
You know that wasn't planned.

00:14:42.697 --> 00:14:44.331
Hey, let's take a selfie, come
on.

00:14:44.365 --> 00:14:45.233
No, no, no, no no.

00:14:45.265 --> 00:14:46.367
No pictures, okay?

00:14:46.833 --> 00:14:47.635
All right.

00:14:47.668 --> 00:14:48.836
Come, let's go then.

00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:04.820
Abu, Abu, Abu, Abu,
Abu, Abu!

00:15:26.006 --> 00:15:29.243
Abu, Abu, Abu, Abu, Abu, Abu,
Abu, Abu!

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:36.184
Thank you.

00:15:36.783 --> 00:15:38.285
Aww.

00:15:48.895 --> 00:15:51.765
Thank you Pundit Ji for your
kind support.

00:15:51.798 --> 00:15:54.468
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

00:15:59.974 --> 00:16:04.980
I want to serve Nepal and you...
Bless me.

00:16:09.049 --> 00:16:10.885
Give me your blessings!

00:17:01.769 --> 00:17:02.803
Who is that?

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:06.441
Yes?

00:17:06.973 --> 00:17:08.009
What do you want?

00:17:08.509 --> 00:17:09.411
Rani, Right?

00:17:09.443 --> 00:17:10.845
It's me.

00:17:10.877 --> 00:17:13.281
We spoke when mom did the
video chat with you, remember?

00:17:14.816 --> 00:17:16.918
Oh my god!

00:17:16.951 --> 00:17:18.653
What wrong with you?

00:17:18.685 --> 00:17:19.820
What do you mean?

00:17:20.454 --> 00:17:21.088
Nothing.

00:17:21.122 --> 00:17:22.356
Please come inside.

00:17:34.035 --> 00:17:35.370
He not home.

00:17:38.873 --> 00:17:40.342
Where is he?

00:17:40.807 --> 00:17:42.844
He go shelter everyday.

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:45.012
Shelter?

00:17:45.546 --> 00:17:46.715
Yes.

00:17:46.748 --> 00:17:50.018
He helping homeless
people with Namrata mam.

00:17:51.652 --> 00:17:52.987
Namrata?

00:17:53.019 --> 00:17:54.588
Yes, Namrata.

00:17:55.021 --> 00:17:55.889
Your friend.

00:17:55.923 --> 00:17:56.924
Remember?

00:17:58.625 --> 00:17:59.894
Will he be back soon?

00:18:01.028 --> 00:18:02.697
Why you dress like this?

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:03.999
You have a problem?

00:18:08.603 --> 00:18:10.605
I'll get some tea for you.

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:14.543
I've been waiting for
you Ismail.

00:18:15.643 --> 00:18:17.612
You have a lot to do for me
here.

00:18:18.179 --> 00:18:19.848
Come, let's go.

00:18:32.426 --> 00:18:33.028
Praveen.

00:18:34.028 --> 00:18:35.029
Sir.

00:18:35.863 --> 00:18:37.032
Relax.

00:18:37.798 --> 00:18:38.799
Sir it seems like I'll have

00:18:38.833 --> 00:18:40.535
all the evidence that I need
sir.

00:18:40.934 --> 00:18:42.036
Okay.

00:18:42.068 --> 00:18:44.071
We'll have Abu and Pundit Ji.

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:46.575
No mistakes, huh?

00:18:47.875 --> 00:18:48.876
Sir.

00:18:59.886 --> 00:19:01.056
Hey, look out!

00:19:02.923 --> 00:19:04.393
Do you Remember this?

00:19:05.159 --> 00:19:06.628
Yeah.

00:19:06.661 --> 00:19:07.629
She's a bride.

00:19:07.662 --> 00:19:08.896
Did you forget what happened

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:11.099
when Namrata went through the
same ritual?

00:19:11.132 --> 00:19:12.967
She hid your picture in the
ritual plate

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.635
and sort of became your wife.

00:19:50.637 --> 00:19:52.173
Listen.

00:19:52.205 --> 00:19:55.609
Vacate this place and set
up camp some where else.

00:19:57.077 --> 00:19:59.513
You're making my boss very
angry.

00:19:59.547 --> 00:20:00.848
You know what he's saying?

00:20:02.549 --> 00:20:05.185
The only way that he is going
to let you live in this city

00:20:05.219 --> 00:20:08.557
is if you accept my proposal to
marry.

00:20:10.057 --> 00:20:11.125
Be my girlfriend.

00:20:12.226 --> 00:20:13.862
Oh, no, no, no.

00:20:18.231 --> 00:20:21.035
My fiance, and we'll
live happily ever after...

00:20:21.067 --> 00:20:22.103
How dare you?!

00:20:22.135 --> 00:20:23.571
Come on Nammu.

00:21:48.288 --> 00:21:49.790
Sunny stop him!

00:21:49.824 --> 00:21:51.058
He will kill him.

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:01.336
You don't know
who you're dealing with.

00:22:02.036 --> 00:22:03.270
You are gonna regret this.

00:22:05.338 --> 00:22:07.908
What a bunch of useless
cowards I have with me!

00:22:31.432 --> 00:22:32.299
Nam.

00:22:32.333 --> 00:22:34.102
- This is...
- I really don't need thugs

00:22:34.134 --> 00:22:35.135
beating up other thugs.

00:22:35.169 --> 00:22:37.238
I can handle my problems.

00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:38.706
Say hello to Bunty.

00:22:40.173 --> 00:22:41.809
Sorry, I shouldn't have
interfered.

00:22:43.009 --> 00:22:44.011
Bunty?

00:22:44.045 --> 00:22:46.047
Namrata!

00:22:46.079 --> 00:22:47.214
Mr. Bhandari!

00:22:48.281 --> 00:22:49.716
Greetings.

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:50.352
Grandpa.

00:22:51.719 --> 00:22:54.122
I was eager to see his new
avatar.

00:22:56.757 --> 00:22:57.692
You've changed.

00:22:58.925 --> 00:23:00.327
I didn't recognize you.

00:23:01.028 --> 00:23:02.329
Namaste, sir.

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:05.033
You picked him up from the
airport.

00:23:05.066 --> 00:23:06.867
Yes sir, he called.

00:23:08.068 --> 00:23:10.038
Why didn't you take him to
your home?

00:23:11.439 --> 00:23:13.240
His aunty might teach him
some lessons from the book.

00:23:25.219 --> 00:23:28.023
Man, she likes you a
lot.

00:23:29.022 --> 00:23:30.357
Who are those thugs?

00:23:31.892 --> 00:23:33.126
I heard they've been harassing
her

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.729
for a quite sometime now.

00:23:35.395 --> 00:23:36.364
They do Abu's dirty work.

00:23:38.199 --> 00:23:39.433
It's a big mess in this city.

00:23:40.734 --> 00:23:42.336
And your grandpa has filed a law
suit

00:23:42.368 --> 00:23:44.772
against Abu who's trying
to grab this camp land.

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:55.950
Children are always
cause of worry for parents.

00:23:55.982 --> 00:23:57.418
Not you of course.

00:23:58.152 --> 00:23:59.721
Why has he come back now?

00:24:00.354 --> 00:24:01.855
Don't think of Bunty.

00:24:04.924 --> 00:24:07.194
Mr. Bhandari, What
are you not telling me?

00:24:08.429 --> 00:24:11.365
Bunty is a dead man if he's
not stopped.

00:24:13.768 --> 00:24:14.369
Get that.

00:24:24.944 --> 00:24:27.347
Excuse me officer, those
men haven been harassing me,

00:24:27.381 --> 00:24:28.349
and it's a daily affair.

00:24:28.382 --> 00:24:30.284
Can you please talk to them?

00:24:30.317 --> 00:24:32.819
You still have to go to the
station to lodge a complaint.

00:24:32.853 --> 00:24:34.489
It's two blocks down that way.

00:24:37.124 --> 00:24:38.927
I'm sorry, who are you?

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:42.463
Inspector Praveen Kumar
Gurung, special branch.

00:25:00.914 --> 00:25:02.317
Wow!

00:25:03.851 --> 00:25:06.821
How beautiful!

00:25:07.488 --> 00:25:09.257
Don't get lost.

00:25:11.325 --> 00:25:12.861
- Salam.
- Salam.

00:25:14.194 --> 00:25:15.562
So you two know each other?

00:25:15.596 --> 00:25:16.798
Come on Sunny.

00:25:20.201 --> 00:25:21.803
Welcome back!

00:25:22.469 --> 00:25:23.471
He'll be staying with us
tonight.

00:25:25.271 --> 00:25:27.040
I hope you guys don't mind.

00:25:27.575 --> 00:25:28.576
Just tonight?

00:25:28.609 --> 00:25:30.443
Yeah, I have a flight
to catch in the morning.

00:25:30.477 --> 00:25:31.813
Oh.

00:25:32.246 --> 00:25:33.181
Why don't you talk.

00:25:33.213 --> 00:25:34.948
I'll get something to drink.

00:25:34.981 --> 00:25:36.584
Two coffees, Sunny.

00:25:36.616 --> 00:25:37.884
Love you.

00:25:37.917 --> 00:25:38.852
Love you too.

00:25:44.023 --> 00:25:44.858
So its true.

00:25:46.192 --> 00:25:47.595
What is?

00:25:47.627 --> 00:25:49.830
That you're
looking for your father.

00:25:50.897 --> 00:25:53.000
Don't you want to know
where your brother is?

00:25:54.201 --> 00:25:56.002
I know where he is.

00:25:56.036 --> 00:25:57.038
In hell.

00:25:58.271 --> 00:25:59.807
Don't say that, please.

00:26:00.641 --> 00:26:02.176
Listen.

00:26:02.209 --> 00:26:04.010
My brother was an addict,
Faisal.

00:26:04.044 --> 00:26:05.446
An alcoholic.

00:26:05.479 --> 00:26:07.081
My father is a warrior.

00:26:08.147 --> 00:26:08.948
Jihadi.

00:26:10.351 --> 00:26:13.054
Oh please don't start all over
again.

00:26:13.086 --> 00:26:15.557
I know the Holy Quran much
better than you think you know.

00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:18.492
Let's go!

00:26:20.326 --> 00:26:23.030
Did you see everything?

00:27:20.186 --> 00:27:21.321
Please sir.

00:27:22.155 --> 00:27:23.390
Give me one more chance.

00:27:26.226 --> 00:27:27.428
Come on.

00:27:28.095 --> 00:27:28.596
Your chance.

00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:30.565
Come on!

00:27:37.604 --> 00:27:38.605
Hit it.

00:27:55.355 --> 00:27:56.423
Sher Thapa.

00:27:59.492 --> 00:28:04.298
Faith is the foundation of
all relationships with me.

00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:05.966
I had so much trust in you.

00:28:21.647 --> 00:28:24.017
Cheater, cheater

00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:25.519
Rai Ji?

00:28:25.551 --> 00:28:27.221
- Namaste.
- Namaste.

00:28:28.721 --> 00:28:30.991
Can we go inside?

00:28:31.392 --> 00:28:32.626
I brought the money.

00:28:33.192 --> 00:28:34.127
See.

00:28:34.161 --> 00:28:35.363
Told you.

00:28:35.729 --> 00:28:36.998
Bribe.

00:28:38.332 --> 00:28:40.001
I not take your case.

00:28:40.467 --> 00:28:42.036
Dirty money.

00:28:42.068 --> 00:28:43.037
Dirty money?

00:28:44.371 --> 00:28:45.740
What do you mean dirty money?

00:28:46.539 --> 00:28:47.709
This is my pension.

00:28:54.213 --> 00:28:55.249
Complicated.

00:28:55.749 --> 00:28:56.616
Sorry.

00:28:56.650 --> 00:28:57.384
Let's go.

00:28:57.417 --> 00:28:58.552
Mr. Rai.

00:28:59.586 --> 00:29:01.622
Is that all you can say?

00:29:01.654 --> 00:29:02.690
Complicated?

00:29:07.227 --> 00:29:09.030
Stay far from this camp.

00:29:13.166 --> 00:29:14.401
Coward.

00:29:16.569 --> 00:29:18.605
Shut your mouth!

00:29:19.807 --> 00:29:22.710
Go now before Abu come to cut
your head.

00:31:51.525 --> 00:31:52.727
Go!

00:35:18.965 --> 00:35:20.934
- How are you feeling
now?

00:35:37.784 --> 00:35:40.054
This will rejuvenate you.

00:35:43.123 --> 00:35:45.760
Ashish told me what happened at
the camp.

00:35:46.693 --> 00:35:47.928
I sent him looking for you.

00:35:54.934 --> 00:35:58.405
I have been loyal and
done everything for Abu.

00:36:00.139 --> 00:36:01.975
But for one small...

00:36:03.476 --> 00:36:04.844
He does this to me?

00:36:08.114 --> 00:36:10.650
And that... Afghan even...

00:36:10.684 --> 00:36:12.787
he even threatened to harm my
family!

00:36:15.856 --> 00:36:17.458
You are my new warrior.

00:36:18.625 --> 00:36:19.226
Look up!

00:36:20.827 --> 00:36:22.496
Look up, show me your face.

00:36:24.797 --> 00:36:26.199
Let the fear strike them.

00:36:27.534 --> 00:36:29.603
You are the Shiva-Gana.

00:36:29.635 --> 00:36:30.938
You are the destroyer.

00:36:32.271 --> 00:36:35.074
Do as I say and you'll have your
revenge.

00:36:35.108 --> 00:36:36.810
I will!

00:36:36.842 --> 00:36:38.611
You have to make a sacrifice.

00:36:39.512 --> 00:36:41.148
I will!

00:36:41.181 --> 00:36:42.817
You are the destroyer.

00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:44.952
I am the destroyer!

00:36:44.985 --> 00:36:48.055
- Bum bum bole!
- Bum bum bole!

00:36:48.088 --> 00:36:49.756
You have to make a sacrifice.

00:36:49.789 --> 00:36:51.124
I will!

00:36:51.157 --> 00:36:53.026
You have to make a sacrifice.

00:36:53.059 --> 00:36:54.928
Bum bum bole!

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:56.663
I am the destroyer.

00:36:56.695 --> 00:36:58.164
I am the destroyer!

00:36:58.197 --> 00:37:01.501
- Bum bum bole!
- Bum bum bole!

00:37:02.001 --> 00:37:03.837
Bum bum bole!

00:37:04.603 --> 00:37:06.172
I am the destroyer!

00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:11.210
- Bum bum bole!
- Bum bum bole!

00:37:21.688 --> 00:37:23.155
Is he there?

00:37:23.188 --> 00:37:24.824
Can I talk to him?

00:37:24.858 --> 00:37:27.728
You will soon.

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:29.862
Someone will meet you at the
address

00:37:29.896 --> 00:37:31.231
and they'll bring you to us.

00:37:32.766 --> 00:37:33.767
Someone is coming.

00:37:38.737 --> 00:37:39.806
Yeah?

00:37:39.838 --> 00:37:40.806
Grandpa.

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:42.076
Should I send him here?

00:37:42.909 --> 00:37:44.010
No.

00:37:44.043 --> 00:37:45.045
Okay.

00:37:55.655 --> 00:37:56.624
Grandpa.

00:37:57.623 --> 00:37:58.259
Yes?

00:38:02.929 --> 00:38:04.831
I'll leave you two alone.

00:38:04.864 --> 00:38:05.932
Thank you.

00:38:07.067 --> 00:38:09.135
I told him you were
praying.

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:16.277
Guess who the author is.

00:38:19.244 --> 00:38:21.548
Why do you hate your family so
much?

00:38:22.916 --> 00:38:26.586
Mom said it is by your
favorite author

00:38:26.619 --> 00:38:28.788
and made me read every
book since I was little.

00:38:32.858 --> 00:38:36.297
Bunty, What do you know about
Islam?

00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:38.865
More than...

00:38:38.898 --> 00:38:39.900
Kafirs.

00:38:41.067 --> 00:38:42.835
Is that's all you can say?

00:38:46.039 --> 00:38:48.576
I don't have to provide
you any explanation grandpa.

00:38:50.777 --> 00:38:52.612
What do you know about your
father?

00:38:54.213 --> 00:38:56.282
As much a separated son would
know.

00:38:58.284 --> 00:39:00.086
I will tell you about your
father.

00:39:01.353 --> 00:39:05.291
He was an alcoholic,
and he was addicted to...

00:39:05.324 --> 00:39:06.326
No!

00:39:06.893 --> 00:39:08.695
You sent mom away.

00:39:08.728 --> 00:39:10.329
Dad left because of you.

00:39:10.362 --> 00:39:11.931
Who told you these lies?

00:39:18.704 --> 00:39:20.340
They're making you sick my son.

00:39:21.807 --> 00:39:23.342
Your mother has told me
everything.

00:39:23.376 --> 00:39:24.845
They are my family.

00:39:24.878 --> 00:39:26.246
I am going to join my true
family!

00:39:26.278 --> 00:39:28.282
- Don't you understand?
- Bunty!

00:40:09.722 --> 00:40:10.324
Well.

00:40:12.092 --> 00:40:13.661
He's dead for me now.

00:40:36.815 --> 00:40:38.384
Namaste, sir.

00:40:46.092 --> 00:40:47.394
- Here?
- Oh yeah.

00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:19.326
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:41:21.126 --> 00:41:22.061
Sorry, I'm late.

00:41:22.094 --> 00:41:23.395
I had to finish my prayer.

00:41:23.429 --> 00:41:25.164
I actually got lost on my way
here.

00:41:25.864 --> 00:41:26.966
Ah.

00:41:28.367 --> 00:41:30.237
It's been a
while since I came here too.

00:41:31.070 --> 00:41:32.939
I feel peace and calm.

00:41:32.972 --> 00:41:34.240
Thank you for coming.

00:41:35.275 --> 00:41:36.943
I'm leaving tomorrow.

00:41:36.976 --> 00:41:38.945
There won't be any problem,
promise.

00:41:39.813 --> 00:41:41.081
You're not the problem.

00:41:42.282 --> 00:41:44.084
I shouldn't have
interfered.

00:41:45.385 --> 00:41:48.188
Yes, now that you have,
we need you even more.

00:41:50.322 --> 00:41:51.324
I can't.

00:41:53.193 --> 00:41:54.528
This is not my world.

00:41:57.297 --> 00:41:58.532
Really?

00:42:18.217 --> 00:42:19.585
Namrata.

00:42:24.157 --> 00:42:25.358
Oh my god!

00:42:25.391 --> 00:42:27.860
This is Suresh Bhandari!

00:42:27.893 --> 00:42:28.961
Mr. Bhandari.

00:42:28.994 --> 00:42:29.862
Let's go!

00:42:29.896 --> 00:42:30.864
We have to do something!

00:42:30.896 --> 00:42:31.364
Let's go.

00:42:31.396 --> 00:42:32.465
Hey!

00:42:40.539 --> 00:42:42.842
Faisal we have to go

00:42:42.876 --> 00:42:44.144
- to the police.
- We can't go to the police.

00:42:46.545 --> 00:42:47.480
Who's that?

00:42:50.048 --> 00:42:51.117
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

00:42:51.150 --> 00:42:52.318
Check the phone!

00:42:53.952 --> 00:42:56.456
We will not
tolerate any contamination.

00:42:56.489 --> 00:42:57.557
Stop the car!

00:43:05.530 --> 00:43:07.567
Those who dare...

00:43:09.235 --> 00:43:11.405
shall die!

00:43:34.027 --> 00:43:35.362
Namrata.

00:43:39.532 --> 00:43:41.535
This is the same guy that was at
the camp.

00:43:42.969 --> 00:43:46.606
Are you sure, all this isn't
about you?

00:44:20.273 --> 00:44:22.575
Why are you Faisal and not
Bunty?

00:44:22.608 --> 00:44:24.044
What do you know about my
faith?

00:44:24.077 --> 00:44:25.111
Nothing!

00:44:25.143 --> 00:44:25.978
Do you?

00:44:28.614 --> 00:44:29.916
Just forget it.

00:44:40.693 --> 00:44:43.297
Do you know where to
find him?

00:44:44.697 --> 00:44:47.099
Faisal, we have to go to the
police.

00:44:58.177 --> 00:44:59.046
Who's this idiot?

00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:01.481
Who's he?

00:45:05.784 --> 00:45:08.355
I don't want
anymore killing please.

00:45:08.387 --> 00:45:10.690
Just let him in and let
the police do their job.

00:45:12.057 --> 00:45:13.025
I'm his blood.

00:45:14.092 --> 00:45:15.161
They shed it first.

00:45:28.173 --> 00:45:29.643
You looking for me?

00:45:53.599 --> 00:45:56.003
Are you saying Bunty is
responsible?

00:45:56.735 --> 00:45:58.237
Mm-hm.

00:46:01.273 --> 00:46:02.442
Stupid.

00:46:28.201 --> 00:46:32.806
I don't know what you see
in that circumcised boy,

00:46:34.474 --> 00:46:36.376
but I surely do know now

00:46:39.144 --> 00:46:40.480
what he sees in you.

00:46:43.115 --> 00:46:44.583
Sir, watch this.

00:46:45.184 --> 00:46:46.419
Get out!

00:46:46.452 --> 00:46:47.788
Murder video.

00:47:00.833 --> 00:47:03.103
This is a Hindu
nation.

00:47:04.903 --> 00:47:08.340
We will not tolerate any
contamination.

00:47:35.233 --> 00:47:36.802
Welcome.

00:47:39.304 --> 00:47:41.173
Where is he?

00:47:41.206 --> 00:47:42.275
So Abu was right.

00:47:43.309 --> 00:47:44.144
You're here.

00:47:45.610 --> 00:47:47.114
Abu is behind all this?

00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:49.282
No.

00:47:50.449 --> 00:47:51.885
He's always in the front.

00:47:54.887 --> 00:47:56.389
It's an honor to serve him.

00:47:57.722 --> 00:47:58.791
You don't know?

00:48:00.826 --> 00:48:04.898
This entire city runs,
all because of his blessings.

00:48:06.498 --> 00:48:08.868
- I want to know where he is.
- Oh boy.

00:48:12.237 --> 00:48:14.506
You're not from around here,
aren't you?

00:48:14.539 --> 00:48:17.943
Hey, hey, don't get excited
boys.

00:48:17.976 --> 00:48:19.179
He's just a tourist.

00:48:21.646 --> 00:48:23.182
Where did you say you're from?

00:48:23.215 --> 00:48:25.284
You better start
talking.

00:48:25.318 --> 00:48:26.419
Or what?

00:52:17.949 --> 00:52:19.484
Are you gonna talk?

00:52:19.518 --> 00:52:20.420
Yeah.

00:52:20.885 --> 00:52:21.788
Let's go!

00:52:31.597 --> 00:52:32.665
Hello.

00:52:32.697 --> 00:52:35.134
Now listen to me very
carefully.

00:52:35.166 --> 00:52:39.639
I don't want any of this to
be remotely connected to me.

00:52:39.672 --> 00:52:40.907
You understand that?

00:52:42.608 --> 00:52:43.410
Yes sir.

00:52:44.076 --> 00:52:45.612
Do you understand that!

00:52:47.512 --> 00:52:48.514
Sir.

00:52:54.887 --> 00:52:57.757
Stupid, dumb!

00:52:57.789 --> 00:52:58.824
Idiot!

00:53:03.661 --> 00:53:07.634
Abu, Abu, Abu, Abu,
Abu, Abu!

00:53:19.043 --> 00:53:21.012
Look man, we has
been called to do a service.

00:53:21.045 --> 00:53:22.881
Nothing personal.

00:53:25.918 --> 00:53:29.556
If a soldier can kill, he
must be ready to die too.

00:54:00.552 --> 00:54:03.154
This man's head may not matter
to you,

00:54:03.188 --> 00:54:05.191
but it is the beginning
of a war you started.

00:54:20.039 --> 00:54:21.040
Thank you.

00:54:36.855 --> 00:54:38.057
Thank you.

00:54:49.735 --> 00:54:51.271
Allah!

00:55:03.114 --> 00:55:06.285
Nobody says no to Abu in this
town, but your old man did.

00:55:08.186 --> 00:55:11.223
Still, Abu did not order him
to be killed or even you.

00:55:13.626 --> 00:55:14.227
Who did?

00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:16.563
Pundit.

00:55:17.929 --> 00:55:19.097
Sher is with him.

00:55:27.172 --> 00:55:28.608
This is our land.

00:55:29.842 --> 00:55:34.079
No one, or anyone like Abu, to
rule us.

00:55:34.780 --> 00:55:35.281
Are we clear?

00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:44.591
Bum bum bole! Bum bum bole!

00:55:47.025 --> 00:55:48.027
Guru Ji.

00:55:50.695 --> 00:55:52.764
I found this on Suresh Bhandari.

00:55:54.032 --> 00:55:55.835
There's a message I
thought you would like.

00:55:56.768 --> 00:55:57.703
Message?

00:55:58.436 --> 00:55:59.639
Play it.

00:56:01.106 --> 00:56:03.276
Papa, he has left.

00:56:04.043 --> 00:56:05.945
He wants to join his father.

00:56:05.978 --> 00:56:07.680
I have seen him change.

00:56:08.947 --> 00:56:12.285
If he travels to Syria
or Khalifat nation...

00:56:13.351 --> 00:56:14.686
stop him papa.

00:56:14.719 --> 00:56:15.788
Please.

00:56:17.956 --> 00:56:19.892
This is brahmastra!

00:56:19.925 --> 00:56:22.362
The ultimate weapon of
destruction.

00:56:23.728 --> 00:56:26.131
It will destroy Abu Mia and his
tribe.

00:56:29.735 --> 00:56:30.737
You.

00:56:31.836 --> 00:56:33.672
Go back to Abu right now.

00:56:35.940 --> 00:56:39.844
Bum bum bole! Bum bum bole!

00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:55.894
Where were you?

00:56:58.396 --> 00:56:59.831
May I please come in?

00:57:21.186 --> 00:57:22.954
I couldn't do it.

00:57:24.422 --> 00:57:25.457
What?

00:57:33.132 --> 00:57:35.800
This man's head may not matter
to you

00:57:35.833 --> 00:57:37.769
but it is the beginning
of a war you started.

00:57:45.911 --> 00:57:47.079
I'm sorry.

00:57:57.322 --> 00:57:59.959
Grand father told me
everything.

00:58:02.460 --> 00:58:05.296
I promised I'd do anything to
stop you.

00:58:05.329 --> 00:58:07.799
I'm so happy you didn't, Faisal.

00:58:09.034 --> 00:58:10.503
You're not like them.

00:58:11.335 --> 00:58:12.437
I've let them down.

00:58:12.471 --> 00:58:13.038
No.

00:58:13.072 --> 00:58:15.508
No, you freed yourself.

00:58:17.342 --> 00:58:19.778
Grandfather will be so proud of
you.

00:59:18.135 --> 00:59:21.072
You killed the only man who
was opposing me in this town

00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:23.576
and you come here to hide.

00:59:31.182 --> 00:59:33.018
You think I'm stupid?

00:59:35.086 --> 00:59:36.521
Inspector Praveen.

00:59:36.554 --> 00:59:38.824
He's collecting all the
evidence against you sir.

00:59:41.193 --> 00:59:42.495
Can I go now sir?

00:59:43.561 --> 00:59:46.031
Is there something
that you're forgetting?

00:59:53.271 --> 00:59:56.509
I gave Pundit Ji
Suresh Bhandari's phone.

00:59:57.976 --> 01:00:00.179
It has recording that Faisal

01:00:00.211 --> 01:00:03.181
is going to Middle East to join
the war.

01:00:04.615 --> 01:00:07.286
Pundit Ji is going to
connect you to that boy

01:00:07.318 --> 01:00:09.889
and his terrorist group sir.

01:00:09.922 --> 01:00:12.358
Pundit Ji is giving the original
to the Americans.

01:00:13.557 --> 01:00:14.960
When?

01:00:15.293 --> 01:00:16.461
Where?

01:00:23.402 --> 01:00:25.537
It is about making the
connection, you know.

01:00:25.570 --> 01:00:27.573
That American-Muslim boy is here

01:00:27.606 --> 01:00:31.076
and the next thing you
see is Hindu grandfather

01:00:31.108 --> 01:00:33.545
who is fighting a good battle
is murdered like, you know,

01:00:34.378 --> 01:00:35.980
for me they're all same.

01:00:36.014 --> 01:00:37.550
Who are you
referring to Pundit Ji?

01:00:39.150 --> 01:00:41.152
You'll see him when we
deport...

01:00:42.086 --> 01:00:43.556
Is that Pundit?

01:00:44.322 --> 01:00:45.458
Must be hiding that boy then.

01:00:46.057 --> 01:00:47.092
Let's go.

01:00:47.125 --> 01:00:48.193
Stop.

01:00:48.226 --> 01:00:50.296
You have to take it away
from their narrative first.

01:00:50.329 --> 01:00:51.997
What are you trying to say?

01:00:52.030 --> 01:00:54.466
It's clear they want
people to be distracted

01:00:54.498 --> 01:00:57.535
from the real issue, their dirty
work.

01:00:57.568 --> 01:00:59.038
It doesn't matter.

01:00:59.070 --> 01:01:00.405
War is war.

01:01:01.273 --> 01:01:02.374
Now listen carefully.

01:01:04.009 --> 01:01:06.012
That American will meet you
and ask you for the phone.

01:01:06.478 --> 01:01:07.413
Which phone?

01:01:07.445 --> 01:01:09.447
Suresh Bhandari's phone.

01:01:11.682 --> 01:01:16.554
And, tell her, we will
take care of Faisal here.

01:01:16.588 --> 01:01:17.590
Yes sir

01:01:46.684 --> 01:01:48.286
Sir, sir.

01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:50.122
Are you Suresh Bhandari's
grandson?

01:01:50.155 --> 01:01:51.958
Are you Mr. Suresh Bhandari's
grandson?

01:01:52.490 --> 01:01:54.025
Bum bum bole!

01:01:54.059 --> 01:01:54.727
Who's your
contact here in Kathmandu?

01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:56.629
His name is Faisal Mustafa.

01:01:58.496 --> 01:02:00.065
Faisal Mustafa.

01:02:02.067 --> 01:02:04.336
When I said the masked
murderer could be anyone,

01:02:05.403 --> 01:02:08.639
even a relative, I was
wondering.

01:02:08.672 --> 01:02:10.675
Then I made the connection,

01:02:11.809 --> 01:02:13.746
and I thought Suresh Ji was a
Hindu,

01:02:14.713 --> 01:02:17.650
an innocent Hindu, and he's a
Muslim.

01:02:18.215 --> 01:02:19.317
A radical Muslim.

01:02:19.351 --> 01:02:20.619
That's a lie.

01:02:20.652 --> 01:02:22.655
The killer is here and he's
hiding him.

01:02:24.188 --> 01:02:26.190
Americans are calling
him person of interest.

01:02:26.224 --> 01:02:27.660
You know what does that mean?

01:02:28.559 --> 01:02:31.096
They think he's a terrorist.

01:02:32.396 --> 01:02:33.532
So, we should consider
him as a terrorist too.

01:02:33.565 --> 01:02:35.067
Let's go!

01:02:35.099 --> 01:02:36.034
Why don't you ask him

01:02:36.068 --> 01:02:37.536
what is he doing in Kathmandu.

01:02:38.702 --> 01:02:40.239
Is he here on a mission with
Abu Mia!?

01:02:40.271 --> 01:02:41.539
That's a lie.

01:02:41.572 --> 01:02:44.242
This is you and police have to
find out

01:02:44.275 --> 01:02:46.210
what is he doing in my country.

01:02:46.244 --> 01:02:48.014
I'm just making the connections.

01:02:49.246 --> 01:02:52.183
Bum bum bole! Bum bum bole!

01:02:59.590 --> 01:03:01.659
- Bunty!
- Just be safe.

01:03:01.693 --> 01:03:02.661
Be safe, I'll be fine.

01:03:02.693 --> 01:03:03.695
What's happening?

01:03:05.530 --> 01:03:06.398
It's too late.

01:03:06.431 --> 01:03:07.733
He's going back to America.

01:03:08.599 --> 01:03:10.603
No, you listen to me
inspector.

01:03:11.469 --> 01:03:12.538
No one can take him away.

01:03:13.572 --> 01:03:14.573
Bunty!

01:03:15.507 --> 01:03:16.575
Sher told me you like her.

01:03:19.143 --> 01:03:20.145
Good day, Pundit Ji.

01:03:22.414 --> 01:03:23.416
Good day.

01:03:24.449 --> 01:03:25.784
Bum bum bole!

01:03:31.422 --> 01:03:32.490
Leila, what are we going to
do?

01:03:32.523 --> 01:03:34.425
They're going to deport him!

01:03:34.458 --> 01:03:35.726
Just calm down.

01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:36.728
Calm down.

01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:37.797
Listen to me.

01:03:38.896 --> 01:03:40.632
They're not going to deport him.

01:03:43.434 --> 01:03:45.737
I promised Suresh Ji.

01:03:47.438 --> 01:03:49.107
You come to Kupondole.

01:03:49.907 --> 01:03:51.809
I promised Suresh...

01:03:51.842 --> 01:03:53.878
You just be there.

01:03:53.911 --> 01:03:55.446
They're gonna deport him.

01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:56.715
What are we doing to do?

01:03:56.748 --> 01:03:57.782
I'll explain to you.

01:03:57.815 --> 01:04:00.651
After you marry Faisal,
no one can do anything,

01:04:00.684 --> 01:04:02.621
not even the Americans.

01:04:02.653 --> 01:04:04.757
So don't worry everything will
be fine.

01:04:05.590 --> 01:04:06.792
Okay, I'll be there.

01:04:26.177 --> 01:04:29.614
We are here to take
your blessings Pundit Ji.

01:04:30.514 --> 01:04:32.451
Bum bum bole!

01:04:38.489 --> 01:04:41.459
Do you know why people like to
hunt?

01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:45.297
Well, it's fun to kill
an animal where it lives.

01:04:47.231 --> 01:04:50.235
And after killing it, if you eat
the meat,

01:04:50.268 --> 01:04:53.338
oh, it tastes so much better.

01:04:55.507 --> 01:04:57.476
What are you talking about
Abu?

01:04:58.577 --> 01:05:00.412
I'm just making the
connection.

01:05:01.746 --> 01:05:02.847
Correct?

01:05:04.682 --> 01:05:06.684
I know, I know.

01:05:06.717 --> 01:05:10.822
This is your place, and I'm
here.

01:05:12.824 --> 01:05:14.860
I am here!

01:05:16.728 --> 01:05:18.496
What can you do about it?

01:05:20.898 --> 01:05:23.902
When I said I listen to
my wife, I wasn't lying.

01:05:25.269 --> 01:05:26.905
And you know what she said this
morning?

01:05:29.773 --> 01:05:32.344
Don't trust a spineless person.

01:05:34.445 --> 01:05:36.447
Don't do anything stupid Abu.

01:05:37.882 --> 01:05:40.219
It will lead to a war this
land have never seen before.

01:05:48.425 --> 01:05:50.429
I trusted you!

01:05:50.461 --> 01:05:53.431
I had faith in you!

01:06:08.780 --> 01:06:09.882
Ismail.

01:06:19.556 --> 01:06:20.892
Don't worry Abu.

01:06:21.726 --> 01:06:23.561
I take care.

01:06:24.528 --> 01:06:25.797
I take care.

01:06:26.697 --> 01:06:29.969
I like clear blue sky.

01:06:30.768 --> 01:06:31.903
No cloud.

01:06:33.304 --> 01:06:35.306
Not even puffy ones.

01:06:59.431 --> 01:07:00.865
Leila wait!

01:07:00.898 --> 01:07:02.667
Go to the bureau and make
sure the registrar is there.

01:07:02.701 --> 01:07:04.302
Where's the marriage bureau?

01:07:04.335 --> 01:07:05.770
Lalitpur, near the
bank on the first floor.

01:07:05.804 --> 01:07:07.940
- Which bank?
- Go, please go!

01:07:25.023 --> 01:07:26.358
Sunny!

01:07:27.525 --> 01:07:28.994
Go!

01:07:43.608 --> 01:07:45.344
So your name is Faisal right?

01:07:47.545 --> 01:07:48.713
Go to the club.

01:07:49.547 --> 01:07:50.382
You know where it is.

01:07:51.648 --> 01:07:52.984
You'll find the person
that you're looking for.

01:07:54.152 --> 01:07:55.019
I'll do that.

01:07:56.487 --> 01:07:58.556
You have no idea who
you are dealing with.

01:07:59.523 --> 01:08:01.025
Actually I do.

01:08:02.827 --> 01:08:04.429
Grandfather was right.

01:08:04.461 --> 01:08:05.764
There's lot to do here.

01:08:06.731 --> 01:08:08.133
Don't forget.

01:08:08.166 --> 01:08:09.401
He's already dead.

01:08:46.203 --> 01:08:48.539
I've always wanted this.

01:08:48.573 --> 01:08:51.076
The moment to negotiate with
America.

01:08:52.710 --> 01:08:57.149
We would be glad to align
with Mr. Abu's campaign...

01:08:58.115 --> 01:09:00.952
if-he agrees not to disrupt the
handover

01:09:00.984 --> 01:09:02.121
and the extradition.

01:09:09.927 --> 01:09:11.162
I like it.

01:09:12.130 --> 01:09:14.132
Democracy is indeed your
religion.

01:10:05.516 --> 01:10:06.717
How look?

01:10:07.519 --> 01:10:08.820
Hmm...

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:10.721
Good.

01:10:10.755 --> 01:10:13.725
Now it looks like a
secret meeting went bad.

01:10:15.193 --> 01:10:18.163
Obviously not a picnic.

01:10:18.195 --> 01:10:21.699
I want both the heads, Sher
and Faisal.

01:10:21.733 --> 01:10:24.470
Yes, Sher Thapa head first.

01:11:01.573 --> 01:11:02.707
Let's go.

01:11:02.739 --> 01:11:04.675
Mind if I go to my temple and
pray too?

01:11:04.708 --> 01:11:05.711

On the house.

01:11:55.693 --> 01:11:58.896
Who you're looking for is
sitting there.

01:12:04.769 --> 01:12:06.338
And you are?

01:12:07.305 --> 01:12:08.606
A well wisher.

01:12:14.645 --> 01:12:15.246
Thank you.

01:12:46.877 --> 01:12:48.112
Wait!

01:12:48.145 --> 01:12:49.146
Damn it!

01:13:57.180 --> 01:13:58.482
He is coming.

01:13:58.515 --> 01:13:59.850
Get in.

01:14:05.989 --> 01:14:07.091
Sher Thapa

01:15:20.131 --> 01:15:22.000
This morning
Pandit Harshvardhan

01:15:22.033 --> 01:15:23.802
Satyajit Brahmachari found dead.

01:15:25.603 --> 01:15:29.007
Abu Mia Siddiqui suspected of
the murders.

01:15:30.274 --> 01:15:32.377
What will happen to Mr.
Siddiqui's campaign?

01:17:39.170 --> 01:17:41.640
- Bunty!
- Bunty!

01:20:46.657 --> 01:20:48.359
Bunty!

01:20:50.627 --> 01:20:53.530
Bunty, are you all right?

01:21:26.729 --> 01:21:30.501
They say cooking relaxes the
mind.

01:21:31.734 --> 01:21:32.737
I say no.

01:21:33.703 --> 01:21:36.173
Cooking relaxes my entire being.

01:21:38.908 --> 01:21:41.712
Mr. Abu Mia Siddiqui,
you are under arrest.

01:21:42.412 --> 01:21:43.714
It's over Abu.

01:21:45.315 --> 01:21:46.317
Ah.

01:21:48.351 --> 01:21:49.153
Faisal.

01:21:51.354 --> 01:21:54.424
We've been trying to meet
desperately.

01:21:56.260 --> 01:21:57.695
We are same.

01:21:57.728 --> 01:21:59.363
We're not the same.

01:21:59.395 --> 01:22:00.197
You're a killer.

01:22:00.965 --> 01:22:02.233
The law of this land has ways

01:22:02.265 --> 01:22:04.201
to take car of people like you.

01:22:04.234 --> 01:22:04.868
Law of the land?

01:22:07.971 --> 01:22:10.675
You don't want to say
law of Sharia and Sunna?

01:22:11.942 --> 01:22:13.912
- Holy Quran is not...
- Just Sharia and Sunna.

01:22:14.744 --> 01:22:16.413
There is more to that.

01:22:16.779 --> 01:22:17.782
Sir.

01:22:18.748 --> 01:22:20.284
Inspector, what's your name?

01:22:21.018 --> 01:22:22.587
Mr. Praveen Kumar Gurung,

01:22:22.619 --> 01:22:24.889
He was my officer, you guys
murdered.

01:22:24.921 --> 01:22:27.457
Your man killed Sher too.

01:22:28.458 --> 01:22:29.961
It's over Abu.

01:22:32.729 --> 01:22:37.534
It's over when Abu Mia
Siddiqui says its over.

01:23:52.975 --> 01:23:54.478
Take care.

01:23:54.511 --> 01:23:57.015
- Bye!
- Bye to you too!

01:24:17.900 --> 01:24:20.805
By the way you really
look good in the Dhaka Topi.

01:24:21.971 --> 01:24:23.073
Grandfather's.

01:24:23.974 --> 01:24:25.643
I found it on my way out.

01:24:33.617 --> 01:24:35.485
The man from Kathmandu.

01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:37.522
I like that.

01:24:39.422 --> 01:24:42.425
You know, whatever
happens, I want you to know

01:24:42.458 --> 01:24:44.362
that I'm always going to be
there for you.

01:24:52.469 --> 01:24:53.703
It's rigged.

01:24:53.737 --> 01:24:55.440
The whole damn system.

01:24:56.774 --> 01:24:59.344
"Deal with it," grandpa would
have said.

01:25:00.844 --> 01:25:04.681
Sometimes simple things, like
looking at life differently,

01:25:04.715 --> 01:25:05.750
changes everything.

01:26:17.186 --> 01:26:19.856
This is my father.

01:26:19.890 --> 01:26:20.990
I know.

01:26:21.024 --> 01:26:22.827
He was a failure.

01:26:24.828 --> 01:26:28.766
He can be saved if you
continue the journey.
