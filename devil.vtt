02:45.188 --> 02:46.228
Seriously?

02:48.188 --> 02:50.348
Isn't it common sense
to drive slowly at night?

02:50.521 --> 02:51.651
That's quite a dent.

02:53.938 --> 02:55.018
Are you okay?

02:55.104 --> 02:56.734
- Yes, and you?
- I'm fine.

02:57.354 --> 02:59.104
Why did you drive so fast
at night?

03:00.479 --> 03:02.439
- How are the photos?
- Sorry?

03:03.938 --> 03:05.558
There's really no need for that.

03:06.854 --> 03:08.104
What are you talking about?

03:08.813 --> 03:10.773
Photos are crucial
when claiming insurance.

03:11.188 --> 03:12.728
You had better not
change your story.

03:12.979 --> 03:14.149
It's scratched...

04:10.104 --> 04:13.444
Another murder took place
in a land development site

04:13.729 --> 04:15.689
near Cheonan early this morning.

04:16.229 --> 04:18.769
Since last year, many murders
and missing person cases

04:18.854 --> 04:22.444
have been reported all around
the South Chungcheong Province,

04:22.604 --> 04:25.604
but the police
are yet to close the cases...

04:25.688 --> 04:28.438
We want to close them too,
you know.

04:28.896 --> 04:30.306
We want to close cases,

04:31.521 --> 04:34.521
go on vacations,
and get promoted.

04:38.604 --> 04:39.904
Turn off the siren!

04:40.563 --> 04:43.693
No one in this town
gives a damn.

04:44.979 --> 04:47.439
They just couldn't care less.

04:48.021 --> 04:50.941
- What a filthy world...
- Tell me about it.

04:53.521 --> 04:55.851
Gosh, look at those thugs.

04:55.938 --> 04:58.308
Trash like them
should just die.

05:00.146 --> 05:02.766
Where are you going?
We're on a case!

05:02.854 --> 05:04.604
Whatever. Does it look like
we're on a case?

05:04.771 --> 05:06.351
- Tae-seok!
- See you at the scene!

05:07.313 --> 05:09.563
- Can't you even do that?
- I'm sorry.

05:09.729 --> 05:10.769
Seriously.

05:11.729 --> 05:12.769
Please be on your way.
Please go.

05:12.854 --> 05:14.904
- Be on your way. I'm a cop.
- Sir.

05:15.063 --> 05:16.733
I told you
to stay out of my sight.

05:19.146 --> 05:20.266
Block the entrance.

05:20.688 --> 05:21.898
Step aside.

05:22.396 --> 05:25.146
To what do we owe the pleasure
on this hot day?

05:26.063 --> 05:29.273
Does a cop need permission
from thugs to be here?

05:30.021 --> 05:31.021
Sir.

05:31.104 --> 05:32.104
Come on, sir!

05:32.604 --> 05:35.734
Come back another time.
Today's a bad day.

05:36.854 --> 05:38.814
It must be one of those days.

05:39.854 --> 05:42.564
The roads were jammed
but things aren't better here.

05:43.354 --> 05:44.854
All right, fine.

05:48.354 --> 05:50.904
Here. Now please go away.

05:54.896 --> 05:58.646
You bastard. What do you take
Korean cops for?

05:59.229 --> 06:01.349
How dare you try to bribe me?

06:02.188 --> 06:04.188
GAMELAND

06:05.521 --> 06:06.811
Here you go, fucking jerks.

06:07.438 --> 06:10.938
You guys should've
been more careful.

06:12.146 --> 06:16.556
How dare gangsters
try to block a cop's way?

06:21.813 --> 06:23.193
Please continue.

06:23.938 --> 06:25.228
I hope you win!

06:50.271 --> 06:51.271
Boss.

06:56.104 --> 06:57.904
That fucking cop's here.

07:00.771 --> 07:01.771
Put it down.

07:10.521 --> 07:12.731
- Wrap him up and send him back.
- Yes, Boss.

07:18.146 --> 07:20.516
I received 200,000 won
in gift certificates.

07:20.896 --> 07:22.726
Our share is ten percent,

07:24.688 --> 07:26.018
so your total is 180,000 won.

07:27.354 --> 07:29.314
Who the fuck...

07:29.854 --> 07:30.904
Open it.

07:34.646 --> 07:35.646
Salute.

07:35.729 --> 07:36.769
Whatever.

07:40.271 --> 07:43.101
You're charged with illegal
conversion of gift certificates.

07:43.354 --> 07:44.984
Remain silent

07:45.063 --> 07:47.523
or retain a lawyer if you want.

07:48.104 --> 07:49.154
You're coming with me.

07:49.229 --> 07:52.599
Detective, why don't
you come in for a second?

07:52.688 --> 07:54.898
Buddy, come out here.

07:57.979 --> 07:59.349
Don't forget to put those on.

08:03.771 --> 08:05.021
- Good morning, Boss!
- Good morning, Boss!

08:16.854 --> 08:17.904
Yes, it's me.

08:18.646 --> 08:20.306
That bastard's back again.

08:20.479 --> 08:21.519
What?

08:22.188 --> 08:25.478
I sent him to a crime scene.
What's he doing there?

08:27.563 --> 08:29.853
Ask the fucker yourself.

08:30.979 --> 08:32.689
Tell Sang-do I'm heading there.

08:34.021 --> 08:37.151
You can't do this, not when you
receive our monthly fee.

08:37.854 --> 08:39.564
Taking all the money
for yourself

08:39.771 --> 08:42.481
has caused your boys
to disrupt my business.

08:43.354 --> 08:46.734
I already advised you against
gift certificate conversion.

08:46.938 --> 08:49.348
Start a currency exchange shop
under someone else's name,

08:49.563 --> 08:52.603
or share the stakes. You know
what I'm talking about.

08:52.771 --> 08:54.731
All that for some chump change?

08:54.813 --> 08:57.483
I'm busy as it is
setting up new operations.

08:57.896 --> 09:00.596
Can't you cut him off
before he comes over?

09:00.813 --> 09:02.353
My boys need the money.

09:02.438 --> 09:04.648
All right, fine.
I'll take care of the bastard.

09:16.938 --> 09:17.938
What?

09:18.021 --> 09:19.021
Are you kidding me?

09:19.229 --> 09:21.309
I'm your superior, you know.
Where are you?

09:21.396 --> 09:23.516
On my way to the crime scene.
I'm hanging up.

09:24.646 --> 09:26.476
I really don't like this guy.

09:26.563 --> 09:27.733
Let me just turn off...

09:27.813 --> 09:29.603
- the electric fan.
- Keep walking.

09:34.938 --> 09:36.188
Stop right there.

09:36.563 --> 09:37.733
As you wish.

09:44.563 --> 09:46.353
- Thanks for the ride.
- Thank you.

09:50.104 --> 09:52.314
Seriously? Is this necessary?

09:52.438 --> 09:55.688
I gave you a ride!

09:58.646 --> 09:59.846
Here's my payment.

10:00.729 --> 10:02.019
Now, kneel on the ground!

10:02.354 --> 10:05.274
I'm going to report you.

10:05.479 --> 10:07.099
Bloody traffic jam.

10:07.188 --> 10:09.598
Where the heck have you been?

10:10.396 --> 10:12.226
Gosh, there's a crowd already.

10:12.979 --> 10:14.019
Get rid of them.

10:14.771 --> 10:17.231
Hello, reporters.
One moment, please!

10:17.313 --> 10:20.733
You can take photos later.
Can you all move back for now?

10:22.479 --> 10:25.309
Secure the scene properly!
What have you been doing?

10:25.563 --> 10:27.943
Hey, move aside!

10:28.771 --> 10:30.231
Stay back if you were late.

10:31.229 --> 10:34.479
Don't head toward the bridge
and stay close.

10:35.854 --> 10:39.194
I just received a call
requesting for backup.

10:53.104 --> 10:54.154
Move back, please.

10:56.063 --> 10:58.733
People are gathering over there!

10:58.813 --> 11:00.063
We're gaining an audience!

11:00.146 --> 11:01.346
Good day, officer.

11:01.896 --> 11:03.146
Did you identify the victim?

11:03.229 --> 11:05.729
We're checking his vehicle
number, so we'll find out soon.

11:13.354 --> 11:14.984
He died only a few hours ago

11:16.604 --> 11:18.774
between three and five
this morning.

11:19.229 --> 11:21.649
Cause of death is blood loss
due to stabbing

11:21.729 --> 11:24.229
or a heart attack.

11:24.563 --> 11:25.773
That's my initial impression.

11:26.354 --> 11:28.234
Hey, come and take some photos.

11:29.688 --> 11:30.768
Did you get it?

11:40.896 --> 11:43.516
Make sure
you don't miss anything.

11:44.729 --> 11:46.769
Hey, Seo-jin. Over here!

11:47.104 --> 11:48.154
Can you take a look at this?

11:48.854 --> 11:51.904
I told you not to call me
by name at crime scenes.

11:52.438 --> 11:55.018
My apologies, Chief Cha.
Anyway, please take a look.

11:55.354 --> 11:56.404
What is it?

11:58.354 --> 11:59.484
Looks like rear-end collision, right?

12:02.063 --> 12:04.903
It does seem that way,
but then again, it doesn't.

12:06.479 --> 12:08.189
Could this be the motive?

12:08.938 --> 12:11.268
I wish it was. It's better
than premeditated murder.

12:30.354 --> 12:32.524
By the way, I should thank you

12:32.729 --> 12:35.649
for turning one of my boys
into a cripple.

12:35.854 --> 12:38.194
There are rules for a reason,
you know.

12:41.188 --> 12:42.228
Whatever.

12:43.104 --> 12:45.904
So businesses will be separate
but we'll share engineers.

12:46.313 --> 12:47.313
Got it.

12:48.021 --> 12:51.351
Shouldn't we resolve
the turf issue though?

12:51.896 --> 12:52.936
Let's be flexible about this.

12:58.938 --> 13:01.058
- Sang-do.
- Yes?

13:03.354 --> 13:06.234
If you keep getting favors,
you'll end up getting spoiled.

13:07.146 --> 13:11.846
Don't make trouble, and manage
the shop I assigned you.

13:12.146 --> 13:14.846
Everyone has his limit.

13:15.729 --> 13:17.269
If you cross the line,
you'll die.

13:20.146 --> 13:23.186
Come on, do you really think so?

13:24.479 --> 13:25.809
Guus Hiddink once said this.

13:26.729 --> 13:28.979
"I'm still fucking hungry."

13:30.813 --> 13:32.443
I have no capital,
no connections,

13:33.354 --> 13:35.774
so I'm still hungry.

13:39.229 --> 13:40.229
Sir.

13:40.771 --> 13:44.351
My boss is being lenient
because you two are friends.

13:45.479 --> 13:48.649
That's why he's giving you
the technology and engineers.

13:49.104 --> 13:50.904
The slot arcade business

13:50.979 --> 13:56.059
is nothing like fighting
over these bars and clubs!

13:56.146 --> 13:58.516
Are you raising your voice
in front of our bosses?

13:58.604 --> 14:01.194
Give us what?
Just shut up, asshole!

14:01.271 --> 14:02.901
Do you have a death wish?

14:03.271 --> 14:04.351
Shut the fuck up!

14:05.813 --> 14:07.813
Is this how you train your boys?

14:09.313 --> 14:10.693
Look at him glaring at me.

14:11.521 --> 14:12.561
Hey, Dong-su.

14:14.104 --> 14:16.404
Why are you
acting so high and mighty

14:16.479 --> 14:17.849
when all you give me
are only the crumbs?

14:21.104 --> 14:23.104
This type of transaction
won't keep the peace.

14:32.396 --> 14:33.436
Come here.

14:34.521 --> 14:35.521
Yes, Boss.

14:40.521 --> 14:43.481
You shouldn't
interrupt our conversation.

14:44.021 --> 14:45.021
Come here.

14:48.646 --> 14:50.306
You little fucker.

15:02.021 --> 15:03.731
There. Now we can work in peace.

15:12.188 --> 15:13.228
Drink up.

15:20.229 --> 15:21.309
It's good.

15:22.896 --> 15:25.806
CHEONAN POLICE STATION

15:26.354 --> 15:28.354
Choe Jeong-gyu, 46 years old.

15:28.479 --> 15:31.309
No enemies, debts, lawsuits
or anything like that.

15:31.771 --> 15:33.021
The autopsy report was obvious.

15:33.354 --> 15:34.774
He has over
a dozen stab wounds.

15:35.188 --> 15:36.518
The murderer is obviously
an amateur.

15:36.604 --> 15:37.984
He just went nuts.

15:38.354 --> 15:41.154
I don't feel comfortable
calling the culprit an amateur.

15:41.896 --> 15:43.056
No evidence was left behind.

15:43.354 --> 15:46.194
No footprints, blood, hairs,
fingerprints, nothing.

15:46.979 --> 15:49.559
Since the wallet's gone,
it could be a robbery.

15:49.646 --> 15:51.596
However, the amount
is too small so...

15:51.688 --> 15:53.808
People kill others
for the littlest things.

15:54.521 --> 15:56.351
The meeting's over.
Get the Captain of Unit One.

15:57.229 --> 15:58.229
Yes, sir.

16:02.854 --> 16:03.854
I'm here, sir.

16:06.063 --> 16:08.983
This case is likely
a robbery-homicide,

16:09.146 --> 16:12.306
so look for anyone
with similar criminal records.

16:12.396 --> 16:13.436
Yes, sir.

16:13.729 --> 16:15.899
You guys, back up Unit One.

16:17.479 --> 16:18.769
Three separate cases,
but one killer.

16:19.813 --> 16:20.853
What cases?

16:21.188 --> 16:22.188
Listen.

16:22.896 --> 16:25.976
A reservoir in Seosan
on July 15,

16:26.688 --> 16:29.688
Boryeong Sunbeach Motel
on July 23,

16:29.771 --> 16:31.901
and then last night's case.

16:33.354 --> 16:35.604
A knife was the murder weapon
in all three cases.

16:35.813 --> 16:38.103
Considering the length
and width of the knife,

16:39.521 --> 16:41.061
it could be the same.

16:41.146 --> 16:42.556
No, I'm certain it is.

16:44.271 --> 16:45.441
The suspect is a serial killer.

16:46.313 --> 16:48.103
This isn't the USA, you know.

16:48.313 --> 16:50.523
Gun possession is illegal,
so knives are the most common.

16:51.354 --> 16:52.484
That's nonsense.

16:53.063 --> 16:55.853
There are over
1,000 murders a year.

16:56.063 --> 16:58.693
Going by your logic, half
of them is done by one guy.

16:58.771 --> 16:59.811
Are you nuts?

17:00.729 --> 17:03.849
Who are you to mess with
another jurisdiction's cases?

17:03.938 --> 17:06.938
Does the killer care
about jurisdiction?

17:07.854 --> 17:10.604
If we don't catch him soon,
we'll be in big trouble.

17:11.021 --> 17:13.191
He's too meticulous
for this to be a random killing.

17:13.646 --> 17:15.556
He could strike again
at any time--

17:15.646 --> 17:16.976
This job is too easy for you,
isn't it?

17:17.229 --> 17:18.809
Murder cases aren't a joke.

17:19.229 --> 17:20.519
You can't just
jump to conclusions like that!

17:20.604 --> 17:21.604
That's not...

17:22.938 --> 17:25.308
These aren't random cases
I'm tying together.

17:25.854 --> 17:27.854
They each happened
about a week apart

17:27.938 --> 17:30.348
all around
South Chungcheong Province.

17:31.021 --> 17:33.061
No matter how much we think
about it, we're getting nowhere.

17:34.688 --> 17:36.438
Then the conclusion's pretty
obvious, isn't it?

17:37.354 --> 17:39.314
Screw your nonsense.

17:39.688 --> 17:41.268
Are you so clever that you
decided to raid an arcade

17:41.354 --> 17:43.694
on your way to a crime scene?

17:44.729 --> 17:45.979
Did you have the time do that?

17:46.646 --> 17:48.846
Aren't they criminals too?

17:49.979 --> 17:52.649
Gangsters and killers
are the same shit.

17:52.896 --> 17:55.976
Jeong Tae-seok, what's wrong
with you?

17:57.104 --> 17:58.194
Hey.

18:00.021 --> 18:01.401
Are you that desperate
to get promoted?

18:06.646 --> 18:07.686
Gosh...

18:10.146 --> 18:12.146
Yes, that's what I'm after.

18:13.438 --> 18:15.058
It's why I want
to catch the killer.

18:19.146 --> 18:22.016
The meeting's over, so move it.
Let's get that killer.

18:27.688 --> 18:29.688
I didn't drink, so I'll drive.

18:30.438 --> 18:31.478
But, Boss...

18:32.188 --> 18:33.848
Take the boys and head back.

18:34.313 --> 18:35.403
Yes, Boss.

18:47.479 --> 18:49.019
That's correct, Chairman.

18:49.563 --> 18:52.773
Sang-do may be a bit rash,
but he's a smart man.

18:53.479 --> 18:55.229
He won't make trouble anymore.

18:57.313 --> 18:59.193
Yes, don't worry.

19:04.563 --> 19:06.233
Have a good night.

19:33.813 --> 19:34.853
I'm sorry.

19:35.729 --> 19:37.479
The road was slippery.

19:47.688 --> 19:49.648
It looks fine. You can just go.

19:50.021 --> 19:51.061
Sorry?

19:51.521 --> 19:53.191
But I still hit your car.

19:53.438 --> 19:54.938
It's fine. You can go.

19:56.563 --> 19:57.983
Are you sure about that?

19:58.938 --> 20:00.148
Yes, it's fine.

20:06.771 --> 20:08.401
Son of a bitch!

20:25.354 --> 20:26.484
Damn it!

20:28.938 --> 20:30.018
What the hell?

20:58.688 --> 20:59.808
Who are you?

21:01.188 --> 21:02.228
Come back here!

21:44.896 --> 21:46.056
You're all dead!

22:12.521 --> 22:14.481
You assholes!

23:53.563 --> 23:54.693
Who's there?

24:14.729 --> 24:16.349
Sang-do didn't send him.

24:18.313 --> 24:19.903
I didn't recognize the attacker.

24:20.229 --> 24:22.309
It was Sang-do, Boss.

24:22.396 --> 24:24.346
He's not a member of a gang.

24:25.104 --> 24:27.354
His attack felt purposeless
and empathetic.

24:27.979 --> 24:29.729
It felt different.

24:29.813 --> 24:32.653
Who else would try to attack you

24:32.729 --> 24:34.189
in our line of work?

24:34.271 --> 24:35.271
Give me that.

24:39.563 --> 24:41.523
It was too dark
to see properly but...

24:41.604 --> 24:43.194
WHITE SEDAN,
DAEJEON 23XX

24:43.979 --> 24:45.729
- Get out!
- Locate the vehicle.

24:45.813 --> 24:47.733
I told you to be careful,
didn't I?

24:47.813 --> 24:49.193
We're actually friends.

24:51.938 --> 24:53.898
Gosh, sorry to bother you.

24:54.813 --> 24:56.443
The patient looks
damn comfy to me.

24:56.521 --> 24:57.691
Who are you?

24:58.146 --> 24:59.726
I brought a box of Red Bulls.

25:00.229 --> 25:03.099
Anyway, I heard
you were stabbed recently.

25:03.854 --> 25:05.654
The hospital
reported it to the police.

25:06.021 --> 25:09.021
Well, you must be
quite embarrassed

25:09.979 --> 25:11.769
to have been attacked like that.
You're a thug, after all.

25:13.521 --> 25:16.191
It's not as embarrassing
as being a cop.

25:16.646 --> 25:18.436
Cops are so incompetent

25:18.854 --> 25:21.444
that bad things keep happening
to model citizens.

25:22.563 --> 25:23.653
Unbelievable.

25:27.313 --> 25:30.023
Right, model citizen,
Jang Dong-su,

25:31.188 --> 25:33.848
tell me everything
about last night.

25:33.938 --> 25:35.268
I'll catch him for you.

25:36.729 --> 25:38.649
I can probably catch him faster.

25:38.896 --> 25:40.016
Really?

25:40.896 --> 25:43.056
Jeez. Do you want to bet?

25:44.271 --> 25:46.731
Spill it, asshole.

25:47.813 --> 25:49.653
Like I said,
I'll catch him for you.

25:52.354 --> 25:54.314
Fine. Do you mind?

25:58.354 --> 26:03.354
I tripped last night
and hurt myself.

26:11.646 --> 26:13.266
Right, okay.

26:14.229 --> 26:16.019
You should really
watch your step.

26:16.646 --> 26:21.056
Unlucky bastards can trip
and fall on multiple knives.

27:10.563 --> 27:13.653
Jang's car is a black Mercedes
with the number 3849, right?

27:17.854 --> 27:19.024
Got it, I'll hang up.

27:25.854 --> 27:27.734
Son of a bitch.

27:29.854 --> 27:31.604
A rear-end collision.

27:33.229 --> 27:34.899
White sedan.

27:37.021 --> 27:39.101
I was right, shithead.

27:40.396 --> 27:42.266
WISH YOU A FAST RECOVERY,
HUR SANG-DO

27:48.271 --> 27:51.351
Jeez, look at you.

27:52.646 --> 27:53.686
Are you okay?

27:54.729 --> 27:56.269
- Have a seat.
- I'm fine.

27:57.479 --> 27:59.769
I feel so bad that
I can barely look at you.

28:03.771 --> 28:05.901
What will happen now?

28:06.146 --> 28:09.516
You made a mess right after
we signed the contract.

28:10.938 --> 28:12.148
What would you like me to do?

28:15.021 --> 28:16.941
A lot of my boys
are cripples now.

28:17.688 --> 28:19.438
Pay hospital bills
and some compensation.

28:19.979 --> 28:22.099
and hand over the main store
and also the one in Seongan.

28:25.479 --> 28:27.769
I'll make sure your boys
are well compensated.

28:29.354 --> 28:30.354
And the shops?

28:31.979 --> 28:33.439
Was this your plan all along?

28:39.354 --> 28:40.444
Dong-su.

28:43.688 --> 28:45.018
If I gave the order,

28:47.646 --> 28:48.936
you wouldn't be alive.

28:51.146 --> 28:52.686
Anyway, think about it.

28:53.979 --> 28:55.559
I'm curious too, you know.

28:56.646 --> 28:58.556
Who would mess you up like this?

29:00.604 --> 29:01.654
See you then.

29:02.146 --> 29:03.896
So fucking embarrassing!

29:03.979 --> 29:07.479
A gangster getting stabbed?
I'd just kill myself!

29:11.104 --> 29:13.984
Trust me and give me
two men on this case.

29:14.063 --> 29:16.563
I'll catch that guy in one go.

29:16.771 --> 29:19.311
Why don't you just
go on a vacation?

29:20.021 --> 29:22.311
I barely have enough men
to run this department,

29:22.521 --> 29:25.271
so why are you offering
to take someone else's problem?

29:25.479 --> 29:27.349
Chief, it's a huge case.

29:27.479 --> 29:29.349
If you close one,
others will get solved as well.

29:29.438 --> 29:32.268
It will be a long train
of solved cases.

29:32.688 --> 29:33.978
Piss off!

29:38.354 --> 29:41.814
We finally have a victim
who survived the attack.

29:43.688 --> 29:44.938
Did a witness come forward?

29:53.771 --> 29:54.811
Jang Dong-su.

29:56.479 --> 29:57.599
What? Jang Dong-su?

29:58.896 --> 30:01.186
He was stabbed a few days ago.

30:01.729 --> 30:04.439
A two-hour surgery
barely kept him alive and--

30:04.521 --> 30:05.601
Listen to yourself.

30:05.688 --> 30:07.978
Just think about it
for a second.

30:08.813 --> 30:11.563
What kind of psychotic idiot
would attack a gang leader?

30:11.646 --> 30:14.016
The killer's not involved
with gangs.

30:14.854 --> 30:17.564
I'm sure of it.
It's the serial killer!

30:17.646 --> 30:18.646
Shut it!

30:20.938 --> 30:24.058
This is a gang problem,
I'll assign it to Unit Two.

30:26.188 --> 30:28.728
I'm warning you.
Don't get involved.

30:29.646 --> 30:30.726
Now, get out.

30:31.354 --> 30:33.734
Go easy on covering for him.

30:34.521 --> 30:36.651
This isn't the time for that.

30:39.563 --> 30:40.693
What did you say?

30:40.979 --> 30:42.099
It's what you've been doing.

30:42.729 --> 30:43.939
You son of a bitch!

30:49.646 --> 30:51.146
Let's say you're right.

30:52.479 --> 30:54.099
But Jang is the victim here.

30:54.354 --> 30:56.154
You can't arrest a witness

30:56.229 --> 30:58.189
for not reporting a crime.

30:58.271 --> 31:00.021
How many crimes
has he committed?

31:02.104 --> 31:04.604
We need to bring him in
and have him questioned.

31:05.146 --> 31:06.806
He's pissed off
to say the least.

31:07.021 --> 31:09.731
If we don't do anything,
he'll kill the killer.

31:10.104 --> 31:11.774
That'll leave us
with three unsolved cases.

31:12.188 --> 31:13.768
How can Jang find the killer?

31:14.771 --> 31:15.981
He's a gangster, not a cop.

31:16.146 --> 31:19.686
His men have the resources
to find someone in days.

31:19.771 --> 31:21.101
Also, Jang saw...

31:24.813 --> 31:26.773
the killer's face.

31:34.021 --> 31:35.021
Get out.

31:36.188 --> 31:38.348
You're spewing
a lot of nonsense.

31:39.271 --> 31:40.311
- Get out!
- Jeez.

31:53.688 --> 31:56.348
Why don't you talk
to the landlord?

31:58.063 --> 31:59.153
Jeez!

31:59.771 --> 32:01.601
What am I supposed to do?

32:01.688 --> 32:03.808
I need to work
in order to earn money!

32:05.438 --> 32:07.598
What? Birthday?

32:11.271 --> 32:13.021
How is that important right now?

32:13.479 --> 32:15.099
I'm tired as hell!

32:15.313 --> 32:16.733
I haven't slept in two days,

32:16.813 --> 32:18.603
so don't nag me
about a kid's birthday!

32:19.479 --> 32:20.729
It must be your kid's birthday.

32:23.146 --> 32:24.146
What?

32:26.021 --> 32:27.811
That goddamn kid you mentioned.

32:38.896 --> 32:39.936
Give me that.

32:45.729 --> 32:47.189
Sharp face,

32:47.771 --> 32:50.441
thin cheeks, an angled chin,

32:52.938 --> 32:55.058
and a narrow and long nose.

32:59.229 --> 33:01.809
His lips are big
compared to his nose.

33:08.271 --> 33:09.901
That's pretty close.

33:19.104 --> 33:20.734
Then you shouldn't
have had the kid.

33:22.604 --> 33:23.944
It's not the kid's fault.

33:29.646 --> 33:31.266
Find him before the cops.

33:31.563 --> 33:32.773
I understand, Boss.

34:13.771 --> 34:15.061
Hey, where are we?

34:17.063 --> 34:18.153
Wait. Who are you?

34:55.771 --> 34:57.351
Block the door!

34:57.438 --> 34:58.898
Don't let them come out!

35:01.563 --> 35:03.693
Thank you for your cooperation.

35:06.521 --> 35:10.231
We're cracking down
on illegal slot arcades.

35:10.479 --> 35:12.689
All gamblers should stay put.

35:13.479 --> 35:14.899
So where's the boss?

35:15.896 --> 35:17.766
Get him down here!

35:23.563 --> 35:25.603
Yeah? Hold on.

35:30.229 --> 35:31.729
Okay, go ahead.

35:33.063 --> 35:34.853
Jang Dong-su,
that adorable piece of shit.

35:34.979 --> 35:36.849
He's a scheming bastard.

35:37.521 --> 35:39.981
He meddled with 63 out
of 97 slot machines.

35:40.271 --> 35:42.311
- Should I get a warrant today?
- Hold on,

35:42.729 --> 35:44.099
let me ask him.

35:46.021 --> 35:48.021
So, should I request a warrant?

35:48.563 --> 35:49.773
What do you want?

35:50.188 --> 35:51.518
The one who stabbed you.

35:52.438 --> 35:55.188
Tell me everything,
and I'll let this one slide.

35:56.854 --> 35:58.104
What if I don't?

36:00.729 --> 36:02.439
Since you have my boss
on your side,

36:02.521 --> 36:04.651
I'm no use to you, is that it?

36:06.271 --> 36:08.771
Listen, Jang Dong-su.

36:09.021 --> 36:10.271
The guy who stabbed you

36:11.521 --> 36:13.021
is a serial killer.

36:15.479 --> 36:17.019
He's a bit strange though.

36:17.854 --> 36:19.604
He's different
from other psychos.

36:20.396 --> 36:21.646
And you're the proof.

36:24.604 --> 36:25.984
What the hell
are you talking about?

36:27.396 --> 36:29.976
Why do you think
he messed with you?

36:37.771 --> 36:41.061
Most psychopaths go after girls

36:41.146 --> 36:43.056
or people who are weaker
and smaller than they are.

36:43.146 --> 36:45.016
But the killer
attacks just about anyone.

36:46.021 --> 36:48.521
If we don't find him soon,
more people will die.

36:50.813 --> 36:52.853
What the hell's your problem?

36:53.854 --> 36:56.814
Hand over the information
and do your gangster stuff.

36:56.896 --> 36:58.346
It's a win-win.

36:58.771 --> 37:01.231
I'll catch him,
put him on trial,

37:01.313 --> 37:03.153
and lock him up for good.

37:06.271 --> 37:07.271
Then what?

37:08.188 --> 37:10.018
Nothing. That's how it ends.

37:12.021 --> 37:13.101
That's it?

37:14.271 --> 37:18.481
When the country's biggest
luxury casino is built

37:18.563 --> 37:20.983
on the penthouse
of this skyscraper,

37:21.354 --> 37:23.774
this entire area
surrounding our Zeus building

37:23.854 --> 37:26.694
will become the hottest spot
in town--

37:26.771 --> 37:30.521
Cut the crap. I heard
this place's ruined.

37:30.938 --> 37:32.268
Damn it.

37:34.938 --> 37:37.098
Everyone who lined up

37:37.188 --> 37:38.728
for pre-construction units
have left.

37:39.354 --> 37:43.064
Naturally, investors
are delaying their funding.

37:43.979 --> 37:47.649
Weird rumors have been flying
since your accident.

37:49.021 --> 37:51.851
The Cheongju region
is another problem too.

37:51.938 --> 37:55.018
Sang-do's boys are moving
into our turf.

37:56.146 --> 37:57.476
What about the punk
who stabbed me?

37:58.271 --> 38:00.481
We found his car

38:00.563 --> 38:02.233
on the Sintanjin-bound
national highway.

38:02.979 --> 38:03.979
His car?

38:04.479 --> 38:07.059
It was parked at a rest area
for a few days.

38:07.271 --> 38:08.651
The boys found it.

38:08.729 --> 38:11.479
- Where is the car now?
- We brought it back.

38:12.146 --> 38:15.146
Anyway, there was a murder
a few days ago in that area.

38:16.021 --> 38:19.941
And this. I don't know
if it was dumped or lost,

38:20.271 --> 38:23.561
but the boys found it
about 3km away from the car.

38:29.479 --> 38:30.979
Hold onto it.

38:31.354 --> 38:32.524
Yes, Boss.

38:39.229 --> 38:41.189
- Hello.
- This is Jang Dong-su.

38:45.313 --> 38:46.603
What a surprise.

38:47.146 --> 38:48.936
Do you know
the Sintanjin murder case?

38:49.813 --> 38:50.903
What about it?

38:52.479 --> 38:53.599
That bastard did it.

38:54.271 --> 38:55.311
What?

38:58.771 --> 39:00.021
How do you know that?

39:02.354 --> 39:04.444
We found his car in the area.

39:08.229 --> 39:10.269
I've been doing quite well
lately.

39:11.771 --> 39:14.061
I got all the way up here
by risking my life.

39:14.771 --> 39:18.231
Then some random guy comes along
and gets in my way.

39:19.479 --> 39:22.019
What other choice do I have
other than cutting him down?

39:22.396 --> 39:23.806
It's not like I can move aside
for him.

39:23.896 --> 39:27.146
But that psycho
disappeared without a trace

39:27.688 --> 39:30.228
after walking all over
a gangster's reputation.

39:31.063 --> 39:32.313
Hey,

39:32.563 --> 39:35.903
whoever messes with me
has to pay the price.

39:37.438 --> 39:39.898
Reputation is everything
to a gangster.

39:41.938 --> 39:47.148
I'll chop him up
and put him on display.

39:47.979 --> 39:51.519
Are you telling a cop
you'll kill a man?

39:52.313 --> 39:54.443
We punish people
in ways that the law can't.

39:54.646 --> 39:57.596
Are you saying a bad guy
will catch another bad guy?

39:58.063 --> 39:59.103
No.

39:59.813 --> 40:04.063
Two bad guys will catch
a sicko that's even worse.

40:08.771 --> 40:09.901
Here's his car key.

40:15.479 --> 40:17.729
Do you not see me as a cop?

40:18.979 --> 40:21.689
I can arrest you right away,
you know.

40:22.938 --> 40:24.348
You won't though. Why?

40:25.313 --> 40:28.153
Because you want him
more than I do.

40:36.729 --> 40:40.349
I'll provide manpower
and pay the expenses.

40:41.729 --> 40:42.979
We'll share information

40:44.354 --> 40:45.944
and help each other out.

40:46.729 --> 40:47.809
And the prize?

40:48.813 --> 40:49.903
Do we split him in half?

40:50.396 --> 40:52.436
Whoever catches him first
can keep him.

40:53.188 --> 40:57.058
So if I catch him first,
he'll be punished by the law,

40:58.396 --> 40:59.896
but if you catch him,
you'll finish him off, right?

41:01.188 --> 41:02.728
Join the game
if you're confident enough.

41:13.896 --> 41:14.936
Count me in.

41:16.271 --> 41:18.231
You'll regret this, you know.

41:23.104 --> 41:24.194
He's a handsome fellow.

41:25.979 --> 41:27.099
How old did he seem?

41:28.396 --> 41:30.056
About mid-30s.

41:30.646 --> 41:32.766
Rain and darkness
obscured my vision, though.

41:33.646 --> 41:35.346
Keep in touch using this.

41:39.021 --> 41:42.601
A gangster and cop join forces
to catch the devil.

41:42.688 --> 41:45.188
This is interesting!

41:55.813 --> 41:59.443
A gangster and cop join forces
to catch the devil.

41:59.521 --> 42:02.101
This is interesting!

42:02.771 --> 42:03.901
You motherfucker.

42:03.979 --> 42:05.399
We're in the same boat.

42:05.479 --> 42:07.309
I'd be a fool
not to have insurance.

42:08.063 --> 42:10.063
It's not like
we can draft a contract, right?

42:14.563 --> 42:18.313
So you went to all the trouble
to record me?

42:21.604 --> 42:23.234
Fuck!

42:27.354 --> 42:30.604
Did you really think
you could have leverage over me?

42:33.396 --> 42:35.516
This is why I don't trust cops.

42:45.646 --> 42:46.896
Unbelievable.

42:51.146 --> 42:52.976
Just because I'm being lenient

42:53.063 --> 42:54.983
doesn't mean
you can walk all over me.

42:55.563 --> 42:56.813
Listen, you bastard.

42:57.146 --> 43:01.226
When this is over,
I'll lock you up first, asshole!

43:06.146 --> 43:07.936
He stabbed Jang Dong-su too

43:08.354 --> 43:10.064
and is the culprit
behind the Sintanjin case.

43:10.313 --> 43:11.773
So what does this mean?

43:12.771 --> 43:16.401
If things go as planned,
we can close five cases at once.

43:19.313 --> 43:21.273
Mid-30s, male, average height.

43:21.438 --> 43:24.268
Judging from his pattern,
he only kills at night.

43:24.521 --> 43:27.651
He doesn't care whom he kills
and he only uses a knife.

43:28.021 --> 43:29.151
It's one or the other.

43:29.688 --> 43:32.268
He has an obsession
or he's always prepared.

43:33.729 --> 43:35.099
There are no other clues so far.

43:40.729 --> 43:42.269
I made a deal with
Detective Jeong.

43:42.521 --> 43:43.651
We'll catch him together.

43:43.979 --> 43:45.269
Obviously,
we won't tell the others.

43:45.354 --> 43:46.904
How can we trust cops?

43:46.979 --> 43:48.939
How can we trust gangsters?

43:49.021 --> 43:50.151
Who said anything about trust?

43:50.729 --> 43:52.729
We need manpower
to catch the killer

43:52.979 --> 43:55.269
and this isn't a case
we can handle ourselves.

43:55.354 --> 43:57.984
- Let's get the others involved.
- Then what?

43:58.063 --> 43:59.983
The Major Case Squad
will take over,

44:00.063 --> 44:03.353
get the media involved,
and have all the glory.

44:03.563 --> 44:06.693
That's not all.
The Chief is protecting Jang,

44:06.771 --> 44:09.191
so this is the only way
to solve this case.

44:09.729 --> 44:12.099
The Chief will get into trouble too.

44:12.521 --> 44:16.021
Jang has seen his face
and has his car.

44:16.104 --> 44:18.154
We can't only rely
on the drawing.

44:18.604 --> 44:20.354
We need fingerprints and DNA.

44:20.729 --> 44:23.649
We'll help the gangsters
find the killer

44:23.729 --> 44:25.479
and move in to make the arrest.

44:25.854 --> 44:29.564
I'll use the cops
and throw them away afterward.

44:40.479 --> 44:42.269
We're all
tax-paying citizen too.

44:43.021 --> 44:45.311
Let's get support
from the cops for once.

44:50.729 --> 44:53.439
On the outside, it looks like
an abandoned cold store,

44:53.854 --> 44:56.524
but thousands of slot machines
are built here

44:56.604 --> 44:58.104
and distributed
all over the country.

44:58.188 --> 44:59.348
Sons of bitches.

45:06.188 --> 45:07.898
Jeez.

45:08.438 --> 45:09.848
I'm sure there will be
something to find.

45:09.938 --> 45:13.438
Probably his hair, fingerprint,
or even traces of his fart.

45:13.896 --> 45:16.516
We have to find something
no matter what.

45:16.896 --> 45:18.346
We'll comb every inch of it.

45:18.479 --> 45:19.939
Okay, let's begin.

45:21.479 --> 45:23.979
We'll leave all the grunt work to Jang

45:24.354 --> 45:26.984
and go through the cases
that have happened so far.

45:27.479 --> 45:30.149
This is the security footage
from the highway.

45:30.479 --> 45:31.599
Let's go over his pattern.

45:31.688 --> 45:35.268
He used a vehicle
in all the murders so far.

45:35.688 --> 45:37.898
He's always on the move
which makes him harder to catch.

45:39.396 --> 45:42.056
We know of four open cases,
but there has to be more.

45:42.229 --> 45:44.439
Even when dealing
with any other cases,

45:44.521 --> 45:46.811
always consider the possibility
of serial killings.

45:47.021 --> 45:48.651
If you find anything,
report to me right away.

45:49.146 --> 45:50.646
He's a ticking time bomb.

45:51.229 --> 45:54.309
He could pop up anywhere,
so check cases in other areas.

45:54.771 --> 45:56.271
Also, make sure you're discreet.

46:04.979 --> 46:07.649
We'll lock up the gangsters
once the case is over.

46:07.979 --> 46:09.059
Nice, right?

46:11.229 --> 46:13.399
Ultimately, it's up to us
to catch the killer.

46:15.063 --> 46:17.063
Before we do though,
let's take care of Sang-do.

47:14.479 --> 47:15.519
Son of a bitch!

47:20.813 --> 47:21.903
Are you insane?

47:22.354 --> 47:23.854
What are you doing here?

47:25.229 --> 47:26.599
What the hell do you think?

47:27.396 --> 47:28.556
I was waiting for you.

47:30.188 --> 47:31.518
I think you broke my back.

47:31.604 --> 47:33.524
You shouldn't have surprised me
like that.

47:33.604 --> 47:34.904
I almost had a heart attack.

47:36.146 --> 47:37.186
Give me some.

47:42.646 --> 47:45.266
- Nice.
- Could you look into this?

47:45.854 --> 47:47.734
- It's urgent.
- What is it?

47:48.854 --> 47:52.194
Nothing special.
I found some hair and blood.

47:52.563 --> 47:54.773
- Please look into them.
- Jeong Tae-seok.

47:56.604 --> 47:58.944
What's wrong with you?
This isn't like you.

47:59.979 --> 48:01.059
What isn't like me?

48:02.313 --> 48:04.353
It's a filthy world.

48:05.813 --> 48:07.653
I ought to get
my hands dirty too.

48:07.729 --> 48:09.059
Right, it is filthy.

48:25.021 --> 48:26.351
He's a weird one.

48:27.646 --> 48:29.436
He left the weapon
for us to see.

48:31.063 --> 48:33.483
"Killer is still at large
but cops are clueless.

48:34.313 --> 48:36.193
Incompetent cops."

48:37.729 --> 48:41.979
And now,
even a gang leader is dead.

48:42.729 --> 48:44.439
What will you do?

48:45.688 --> 48:46.848
What should we do about this?

48:47.229 --> 48:49.599
Look at you all.
Cat got your tongue?

48:49.979 --> 48:51.349
The Hur Sang-do case...

48:52.313 --> 48:55.153
will be assigned to Unit Two
and they'll investigate it.

48:55.563 --> 48:57.023
Do you still not get it?

48:57.563 --> 48:59.943
Stop staring at the monitor

49:00.854 --> 49:01.904
and hit the streets.

49:02.771 --> 49:04.021
Right now!

49:05.563 --> 49:08.193
I don't care if it's dog crap,

49:08.271 --> 49:09.981
search and investigate whatever
will help solve the case!

49:11.104 --> 49:13.854
At least try to look
like you give a damn!

49:14.104 --> 49:15.194
Hold your heads high!

49:15.521 --> 49:16.521
Yeah, tell me.

49:16.604 --> 49:18.774
Do you have a death wish?

49:19.104 --> 49:21.234
- What is it?
- You said it's nothing special.

49:21.729 --> 49:23.099
I just got the results
on the samples.

49:23.938 --> 49:26.478
- I don't believe this.
- What is it? Tell me.

49:26.854 --> 49:29.604
DNA of the recent
South Chungcheong murder victims

49:29.688 --> 49:31.558
were detected in the samples.

49:31.646 --> 49:32.646
Really?

49:34.521 --> 49:35.651
Is that it?

49:36.104 --> 49:37.654
Was there any unidentified DNA?

49:37.729 --> 49:39.899
- None.
- That doesn't make sense.

49:40.521 --> 49:41.601
Did you run the tests properly?

49:41.688 --> 49:44.478
There was no one else's
but that's not the issue.

49:44.563 --> 49:47.103
- Something big happened.
- Hold on a second.

49:50.938 --> 49:51.938
Go ahead.

49:52.021 --> 49:55.401
DNA of the truck driver
and puppy mill owner

49:55.813 --> 49:58.523
were all found on the weapon
used in the Hur murder case.

49:58.604 --> 49:59.604
What?

49:59.688 --> 50:01.268
It means one person did it all.

50:02.063 --> 50:05.273
It will be officially classified
as a serial killer case.

50:06.979 --> 50:07.979
I've got to go.

50:10.813 --> 50:12.193
Jang Dong-su!

50:13.063 --> 50:14.233
It was you, wasn't it?

50:15.229 --> 50:16.269
It was you!

50:18.813 --> 50:20.023
Sir, I'll have to call you back.

50:20.104 --> 50:21.444
Answer me, motherfucker!

50:25.938 --> 50:28.058
- Are you fucking nuts?
- Damn it!

50:38.938 --> 50:40.268
Bastard!

50:44.271 --> 50:46.271
Your idiot's back.

50:47.729 --> 50:49.229
He barges in here
like it's his house.

50:50.354 --> 50:52.354
Who else?
One of your detectives.

50:52.604 --> 50:53.774
Right, we'll talk later.

50:55.729 --> 50:56.899
Damn it.

50:57.813 --> 51:01.153
A cop in league with a gangster?
Fuck this world.

51:01.979 --> 51:04.479
Aren't you a cop too?

51:06.146 --> 51:07.146
Aren't you?

51:10.479 --> 51:11.689
Tell me, asshole.

51:12.313 --> 51:13.943
Did you kill Hur Sang-do?

51:17.146 --> 51:18.396
Yes, I killed him.

51:24.646 --> 51:28.396
I blame myself
for trusting a gangster.

51:30.604 --> 51:32.234
You trusted me?

51:33.146 --> 51:34.806
No one would buy that.

51:35.771 --> 51:37.061
Nothing's changed.

51:37.479 --> 51:39.729
We'll still catch
the killer together.

51:40.021 --> 51:41.021
Got it?

51:44.688 --> 51:45.728
When...

51:47.729 --> 51:49.269
this is all over,

51:50.104 --> 51:53.444
I'll investigate you properly.

51:56.313 --> 51:57.733
Whatever.

52:02.563 --> 52:05.853
The murder cases in the region
since July this year

52:05.938 --> 52:08.478
were found to be killings
of a serial killer...

52:08.563 --> 52:11.443
The police were yet
to find any substantial leads...

52:11.521 --> 52:14.271
Major Case Squad
of the South Chungcheong Station

52:14.688 --> 52:17.728
is now working alongside
the Cheonan Police.

52:17.938 --> 52:21.598
The murders were handled
by various regional

52:21.688 --> 52:24.188
police departments, but by
centralizing the investigation

52:24.604 --> 52:29.654
there's new hope
for finally closing the cases.

52:29.896 --> 52:31.976
We wish for these cases
to soon be solved

52:32.063 --> 52:34.233
so that the people
can finally find peace again.

52:34.313 --> 52:37.313
We'll hear more details
from the reporter on site.

52:37.396 --> 52:38.556
You're here early.

52:39.229 --> 52:40.309
Dong-cheol.

52:40.396 --> 52:42.846
I'm outside Ace Hotel,
where the murder took place

52:42.938 --> 52:44.478
on September 3.

52:44.688 --> 52:49.058
The victim of this crime
is said to be Hur Sang-do,

52:49.479 --> 52:52.599
who led a gang
in the South Chungcheong region.

52:53.229 --> 52:56.849
He was said to be
in a turf war with...

52:56.938 --> 53:00.098
If you'd handed over the case
from the beginning,

53:00.188 --> 53:01.518
it wouldn't have come to this.

53:02.646 --> 53:04.686
Murder isn't some child's play.

53:05.604 --> 53:08.654
You guys only ruined
the fucking investigation.

53:09.854 --> 53:13.274
Shouldn't you be more polite
if you're on our home ground?

53:14.813 --> 53:17.103
Well, I'm not wrong, you prick.

53:17.604 --> 53:18.654
Prick?

53:19.104 --> 53:21.024
Keep talking, you piece of shit.

53:21.104 --> 53:22.564
- What was that?
- Sir!

53:22.646 --> 53:24.806
- Bring it on then!
- Come here!

53:25.729 --> 53:29.479
- Fucker!
- Hey, stop it!

53:29.896 --> 53:35.436
On the knife found
at the scene of Hur's murder,

53:35.521 --> 53:38.191
DNA evidence of other victims
were discovered.

53:38.646 --> 53:42.976
A task force was set up to
investigate not only Hur's case,

53:43.063 --> 53:45.653
but other victims' cases
as well, as all the murders

53:45.729 --> 53:48.849
are likely committed
by one killer...

53:49.063 --> 53:50.693
But that wasn't my doing.

53:51.063 --> 53:53.733
The task force that consists
of the Major Case Squad

53:53.813 --> 53:56.563
and Homicide units

53:57.354 --> 54:01.694
will be joined by the country's
top criminal profiler

54:02.271 --> 54:05.901
and forensic experts
from various fields

54:05.979 --> 54:09.689
in order to conduct
a thorough investigation.

54:10.188 --> 54:13.898
The police will remain vigilant
as they are expecting

54:14.104 --> 54:18.194
a huge turnout of gangs
at Hur Sang-do's funeral.

54:29.771 --> 54:31.441
I'm surprised to see you here.

54:33.563 --> 54:36.273
Of course I came.
He was my friend.

55:20.729 --> 55:22.809
- Hello?
- Get over here right now.

55:23.229 --> 55:24.559
Why should I?

55:24.646 --> 55:26.436
To clean up your
own fucking mess!

55:26.521 --> 55:27.771
Get over here.

55:42.271 --> 55:43.521
I don't think we've met.

55:57.438 --> 56:01.598
HUR WAS KILLED WITH MY KNIFE
BY SOMEONE ELSE

57:02.271 --> 57:05.191
Find something useful
if you wish to catch the guy.

57:05.438 --> 57:09.188
If Major Case Squad gets him
first, we are both fucked.

57:11.688 --> 57:13.688
Is this what you've been doing
your entire life?

57:15.021 --> 57:17.351
I pity your sorry cop's life.

57:18.188 --> 57:20.438
So don't commit any crimes,
you moron.

57:20.896 --> 57:23.596
If people like me aren't around,
you would be out of a job.

57:23.854 --> 57:24.904
That's how life is.

57:24.979 --> 57:26.769
Some commit crimes
and some catch them.

57:27.604 --> 57:29.984
Right, and some get stabbed.

57:30.271 --> 57:32.231
The bastard
attacked me from behind.

57:32.813 --> 57:35.153
Still, I took his knife
and got a piece of him too.

57:35.229 --> 57:36.599
Wait, hold it.

57:36.813 --> 57:39.193
- What now?
- You stabbed him?

57:39.271 --> 57:40.271
I did. Why?

57:40.354 --> 57:42.024
I think I found something.

57:52.896 --> 57:54.056
What the hell?

57:55.938 --> 57:57.098
Sons of bitches.

58:17.938 --> 58:19.308
Jang Dong-su, what's going on?

58:20.021 --> 58:21.351
Who are these guys?

58:21.438 --> 58:22.648
Punks.

59:14.979 --> 59:16.059
Move!

59:31.396 --> 59:32.436
Get up.

59:42.021 --> 59:43.851
Go to hell, you asshole!

01:00:31.146 --> 01:00:33.056
Shit...

01:00:37.729 --> 01:00:40.769
Hey! Motherfucker, no!

01:00:41.229 --> 01:00:42.399
Fuck!

01:00:43.646 --> 01:00:44.806
That's enough.

01:00:45.854 --> 01:00:47.024
It's over now.

01:00:48.063 --> 01:00:49.733
You should go.
I'll clean things up.

01:00:50.063 --> 01:00:52.153
No, he's fine.

01:00:52.396 --> 01:00:55.096
He just bled a lot.

01:00:55.354 --> 01:00:56.484
It's just blood...

01:00:56.563 --> 01:00:58.653
Get out of here, asshole!

01:01:15.063 --> 01:01:16.313
Now that there
is enough evidence

01:01:16.396 --> 01:01:18.056
to arrest Hur's killer,

01:01:18.313 --> 01:01:21.653
the police stated that capturing
the suspect is a matter of time.

01:01:22.104 --> 01:01:25.154
Due to the suspect's
limited method of killing

01:01:25.229 --> 01:01:27.689
and small hunting ground,
the police are sure...

01:01:32.354 --> 01:01:34.734
Honey, where are you?

01:02:10.563 --> 01:02:13.483
Are you seriously napping when
something huge has happened?

01:02:15.521 --> 01:02:17.401
Wait. What's with his face?

01:02:17.979 --> 01:02:19.149
Wake up, you idiot!

01:02:21.146 --> 01:02:24.266
What have you been up to lately?

01:02:25.271 --> 01:02:26.311
What the...

01:02:28.979 --> 01:02:30.099
Where are you going?

01:02:30.938 --> 01:02:33.148
Here, take this.
It's a kidnapping case.

01:02:33.646 --> 01:02:35.726
Sun-ho's already there,
so get going.

01:02:36.354 --> 01:02:39.024
A kidnapping case?
How is that important right now?

01:02:39.229 --> 01:02:41.149
We have
a serial killer to catch.

01:02:41.229 --> 01:02:42.349
That's enough!

01:02:45.813 --> 01:02:46.903
Hey.

01:02:48.938 --> 01:02:51.598
Can't you see that
Major Case Squad is here?

01:02:52.771 --> 01:02:55.851
They're working with Unit One,
so take care of this.

01:02:59.438 --> 01:03:03.688
I told you from the start
that this was a serial murder.

01:03:04.354 --> 01:03:06.904
But now Major Case Squad
and Unit One have taken over.

01:03:07.313 --> 01:03:08.903
What the hell
do they know anyway?

01:03:09.771 --> 01:03:11.561
They're clueless jerks!

01:03:12.188 --> 01:03:14.598
You shithead.
What did you just say?

01:03:14.688 --> 01:03:15.938
Shut up!

01:03:19.354 --> 01:03:20.354
Tae-seok.

01:03:21.229 --> 01:03:22.479
You insisted
it was serial killing

01:03:22.563 --> 01:03:23.653
without any evidence.

01:03:24.229 --> 01:03:26.479
There was no evidence
or even a witness.

01:03:26.729 --> 01:03:27.769
If you were so confident,

01:03:27.854 --> 01:03:29.154
you should have caught him
already.

01:03:32.979 --> 01:03:34.019
Damn it.

01:03:42.771 --> 01:03:45.311
The victim was a prolific CEO.

01:03:50.438 --> 01:03:51.478
Tae-seok.

01:03:54.146 --> 01:03:55.766
You'll find the killer if you
look into his acquaintances,

01:03:55.854 --> 01:03:56.854
so get on it.

01:03:59.729 --> 01:04:02.599
Did something happen
while you were with Jang?

01:04:03.563 --> 01:04:05.273
What's with all the scars?

01:04:06.021 --> 01:04:07.191
Something happened, right?

01:04:09.021 --> 01:04:11.021
Cut the bullshit.

01:04:13.104 --> 01:04:15.484
Ask his colleagues
about the women in his life.

01:04:16.979 --> 01:04:18.809
How many times does this make?

01:04:19.438 --> 01:04:21.438
Why do you keep changing
the meeting spot?

01:04:22.021 --> 01:04:23.561
Is he even alive?

01:04:24.146 --> 01:04:26.646
If you want the money,
put him on the phone!

01:04:29.063 --> 01:04:30.603
This is the last time.

01:04:30.729 --> 01:04:32.349
Be at Jeil Snack Bar
in Wolmyeong-dong.

01:04:32.979 --> 01:04:34.019
Come right now.

01:04:41.271 --> 01:04:44.351
What are you doing?
Go inside already.

01:04:44.604 --> 01:04:46.944
Did you come by
to drop off the bag?

01:04:47.438 --> 01:04:48.898
- Yes.
- Please leave it with me.

01:04:50.854 --> 01:04:53.694
Why is she handing her the cash?

01:04:57.521 --> 01:04:58.731
What the hell.

01:04:59.729 --> 01:05:03.809
Tell the world you're here
with cops, why don't you?

01:05:11.271 --> 01:05:13.811
Hey. Who's that on the roof?

01:05:14.438 --> 01:05:15.728
It's him. He's on the roof!

01:05:16.063 --> 01:05:18.313
Dong-cheol, he's headed north!

01:05:18.396 --> 01:05:19.476
Where is he?

01:05:21.271 --> 01:05:22.981
Sun-ho, lure him
into the main street!

01:05:23.063 --> 01:05:24.193
Hey!

01:05:25.063 --> 01:05:27.103
- Where the hell were you?
- Hey, he's moving away!

01:05:27.354 --> 01:05:29.154
Sun-ho, cut him off!

01:05:29.229 --> 01:05:30.229
Stop!

01:05:31.646 --> 01:05:34.436
- I don't see him!
- What? He's right there!

01:05:34.521 --> 01:05:37.981
- The main street!
- Sun-ho, where the hell are you?

01:05:41.979 --> 01:05:43.649
Stop, you bastard!

01:05:47.938 --> 01:05:49.058
Shit, he's bloody fast.

01:05:52.438 --> 01:05:53.728
Stop right there!

01:05:57.104 --> 01:05:59.064
- I'll head down!
- Hurry!

01:06:01.854 --> 01:06:03.314
I don't see him from here!

01:06:03.396 --> 01:06:05.516
- You're dead meat.
- Where did he go?

01:06:06.438 --> 01:06:07.598
Catch up when you can.

01:06:08.021 --> 01:06:10.151
Up the stairs! Now!

01:06:11.188 --> 01:06:12.268
Freeze!

01:06:15.354 --> 01:06:17.354
He just turned the corner.
Block him from the front!

01:06:17.438 --> 01:06:18.518
Which way did he go?

01:06:21.479 --> 01:06:22.599
Over there. That way!

01:06:24.813 --> 01:06:25.943
Go that way!

01:06:36.896 --> 01:06:38.896
Why did you take the bag

01:06:38.979 --> 01:06:40.519
when you don't know
what's inside?

01:06:41.646 --> 01:06:44.476
Why are you shouting at me?
I didn't do anything wrong.

01:06:44.729 --> 01:06:46.849
Someone asked me to take it.

01:06:47.604 --> 01:06:48.944
Who asked you?

01:06:49.354 --> 01:06:51.904
Tell us
or we'll have you arrested.

01:06:51.979 --> 01:06:53.729
I've never seen him before.

01:06:53.813 --> 01:06:57.483
He ate alone and asked me
to take the bag for him.

01:06:59.313 --> 01:07:00.813
He gave me 20 dollars.

01:07:08.521 --> 01:07:09.691
What did he look like?

01:07:10.271 --> 01:07:12.811
Well, he looked quite average.

01:07:13.313 --> 01:07:14.443
Did he only eat food here?

01:07:16.438 --> 01:07:18.558
He drank a bottle of soju too!

01:07:21.563 --> 01:07:22.903
Where's the bottle?

01:07:23.521 --> 01:07:26.441
The labels differ
depending on the brand,

01:07:26.521 --> 01:07:29.191
but they come in
the same bottle.

01:07:30.021 --> 01:07:31.731
Have fun searching.

01:07:32.229 --> 01:07:33.849
You've got to be kidding me.

01:07:38.604 --> 01:07:40.064
- Dong-cheol!
- Yes?

01:07:40.438 --> 01:07:41.688
Just check the relevant brand.

01:07:41.771 --> 01:07:43.351
- It's not--
- Just the relevant brand!

01:07:43.438 --> 01:07:44.898
This is unbelievable!

01:07:45.063 --> 01:07:46.903
All the bottles are the same!

01:07:50.188 --> 01:07:51.688
There's no need
to work so hard, you know.

01:07:52.438 --> 01:07:53.518
Are you serious?

01:07:56.688 --> 01:07:58.938
What about
the steering wheel cover?

01:07:59.854 --> 01:08:01.354
The result will come out today
at the earliest.

01:08:03.146 --> 01:08:07.186
That's why I'll only charge
two million won per machine.

01:08:08.146 --> 01:08:09.146
Thank you.

01:08:09.271 --> 01:08:11.351
I'll send the technicians
if you need them.

01:08:11.479 --> 01:08:14.059
Isn't that too cheap, Mr. Jang?

01:08:14.521 --> 01:08:16.771
Of course, your generosity

01:08:17.521 --> 01:08:19.521
will make us very happy indeed.

01:08:20.521 --> 01:08:24.691
I don't know if I should take
the good deals he offers though.

01:08:24.854 --> 01:08:26.694
Look what happened to Sang-do.

01:08:28.188 --> 01:08:29.598
Watch out, everyone.

01:08:29.813 --> 01:08:32.653
After Dong-su got stabbed,
Sang-do was killed,

01:08:32.729 --> 01:08:35.599
and his lackey disappeared too.

01:08:36.354 --> 01:08:38.154
Just shut up and eat, will you?

01:09:03.646 --> 01:09:04.806
What brings you by?

01:09:06.688 --> 01:09:07.938
Look for this guy first.

01:09:10.396 --> 01:09:11.936
I found an odd fingerprint.

01:09:13.271 --> 01:09:14.981
I don't know if it's damaged.

01:09:15.479 --> 01:09:17.189
He could've put something on
his fingers on purpose.

01:09:17.646 --> 01:09:19.476
I found him with the partial
prints he left behind.

01:09:19.896 --> 01:09:21.096
He's actually a missing person.

01:09:21.729 --> 01:09:24.059
His print was found
on the steering wheel cover too.

01:09:26.146 --> 01:09:28.346
He hasn't come home
in about three months.

01:09:28.438 --> 01:09:29.648
Did he say where he was going?

01:09:29.729 --> 01:09:32.939
When he's off on a job,
he'd be away for a month.

01:09:33.313 --> 01:09:35.063
He's away quite a while
this time though.

01:09:35.313 --> 01:09:37.443
I reported it thinking
something had happened to him.

01:09:37.979 --> 01:09:39.189
Did he make any trouble?

01:09:39.646 --> 01:09:42.896
No, not at all.
He never missed his rent

01:09:42.979 --> 01:09:47.599
and never drank any alcohol.
He's a faithful Christian too.

01:09:48.188 --> 01:09:49.768
He lives a good, clean life.

01:09:59.104 --> 01:10:01.854
BASIS OF MANKIND
WHO RAISED A MONSTER?

01:10:01.938 --> 01:10:04.648
NIGHT DARKER THAN DEATH
SACRED VIOLENCE

01:10:20.729 --> 01:10:22.229
I found an odd fingerprint.

01:10:22.771 --> 01:10:24.481
I don't know if it's damaged.

01:10:24.938 --> 01:10:26.648
He could've put something on
his fingers on purpose.

01:11:02.729 --> 01:11:04.479
It's 017-684-2784!

01:11:04.854 --> 01:11:06.524
Do a background check
on that number.

01:11:07.438 --> 01:11:09.268
Also, the recording of
the kidnapper's voice.

01:11:09.354 --> 01:11:11.654
Send it to me right away.
Right now!

01:11:15.146 --> 01:11:17.936
I heard you paid a ton
for Sang-do's funeral.

01:11:18.354 --> 01:11:21.734
Isn't Dong-su one loyal guy?

01:11:22.729 --> 01:11:24.559
I hope you
show me the same courtesy.

01:11:28.646 --> 01:11:30.556
Didn't I tell you to just eat?

01:11:30.646 --> 01:11:33.306
You talk too much.

01:11:34.521 --> 01:11:37.811
Why are you ruining
this nice lunch?

01:11:38.188 --> 01:11:41.308
I'm looking out
for your fucking interests.

01:11:43.646 --> 01:11:44.846
Just eat your food!

01:11:51.354 --> 01:11:52.734
Please continue.

01:11:54.438 --> 01:11:56.438
I sent you a photo,
so check it right away.

01:11:56.813 --> 01:11:57.903
Also, listen to this.

01:12:00.771 --> 01:12:01.851
This is the last time.

01:12:03.021 --> 01:12:04.771
Be at Jeil Snack Bar
in Wolmyeong-dong.

01:12:05.146 --> 01:12:06.016
Come right now.

01:12:07.521 --> 01:12:08.561
I'm sorry.

01:12:09.521 --> 01:12:11.271
The road was slippery.

01:12:12.188 --> 01:12:14.018
But I still hit your car.

01:12:23.438 --> 01:12:25.648
Name, Kang Gyeong-ho. Age, 35.

01:12:26.479 --> 01:12:29.479
He was abused by his father
and grew up in an orphanage.

01:12:29.646 --> 01:12:30.806
He has no priors.

01:12:30.896 --> 01:12:33.726
He calls his 70-year-old mother
everyday

01:12:33.813 --> 01:12:35.233
although both use
unlicensed phones.

01:12:35.313 --> 01:12:37.103
Until August, his calls were

01:12:37.188 --> 01:12:38.688
mainly from
Chungcheong Province,

01:12:38.896 --> 01:12:42.806
but he's been calling from
all over the country since then.

01:12:42.896 --> 01:12:47.146
We traced his calls
and they were mainly from Ansan,

01:12:47.479 --> 01:12:49.559
mostly from this district.

01:12:49.854 --> 01:12:51.274
- Daegyeong-dong?
- That's right.

01:12:51.354 --> 01:12:52.904
There are a few colleges,

01:12:52.979 --> 01:12:55.269
so tons of cheap rooms,
apartments,

01:12:55.354 --> 01:12:58.734
and thousands of old houses
are in the neighborhood.

01:12:58.813 --> 01:13:01.153
What a hassle.

01:13:01.229 --> 01:13:02.689
Which means,

01:13:03.479 --> 01:13:06.599
he hid here after stabbing Jang.

01:13:06.688 --> 01:13:09.268
You son of a bitch.
Where are your manners?

01:13:09.521 --> 01:13:11.521
Jang? Don't address him
like he's your friend, asshole.

01:13:11.604 --> 01:13:13.064
You fucking gangster.

01:13:14.104 --> 01:13:16.564
You cops are no different.

01:13:18.771 --> 01:13:20.021
Motherfucker!

01:13:20.479 --> 01:13:22.479
- Damn it!
- Let go of me!

01:13:25.979 --> 01:13:27.309
Do you want to die?

01:13:30.771 --> 01:13:31.941
Come here.

01:13:41.188 --> 01:13:42.188
Guys.

01:13:43.729 --> 01:13:45.059
If we don't catch him,

01:13:45.979 --> 01:13:48.059
we're all fucked,
don't you know that?

01:13:51.646 --> 01:13:53.266
We're in the same boat now,

01:13:54.313 --> 01:13:57.193
so let's see this through
no matter what.

01:13:58.813 --> 01:13:59.943
Let's just do it, all right?

01:14:23.021 --> 01:14:25.481
- Did you all receive the photo?
- Yes, Boss!

01:14:25.979 --> 01:14:28.899
As of this moment,
you have one single mission.

01:14:30.104 --> 01:14:32.854
Find this fucker at all costs.

01:14:32.938 --> 01:14:33.978
- Yes, Boss!
- Yes, Boss!

01:14:35.438 --> 01:14:37.268
Keep a low profile,

01:14:37.771 --> 01:14:39.901
and if you see anyone
who resembles him,

01:14:40.354 --> 01:14:43.314
call your superiors at once.

01:14:44.396 --> 01:14:45.976
There will be
five of you in a team.

01:14:46.646 --> 01:14:48.476
The team leader will update us
every eight hours,

01:14:48.563 --> 01:14:49.773
three times a day.

01:15:02.813 --> 01:15:04.483
Centering on Daegyeong-dong,

01:15:04.938 --> 01:15:08.228
search your designated areas
and keep looking further.

01:15:09.354 --> 01:15:12.654
Check cheap motels,
inns, and studio apartments.

01:15:13.354 --> 01:15:14.484
I've never seen him before.

01:15:15.229 --> 01:15:16.979
Then check short-term renters

01:15:17.063 --> 01:15:18.903
as well as
long-term guests at inns.

01:15:19.438 --> 01:15:21.518
Search all these places
without fail.

01:15:22.604 --> 01:15:23.654
Doan-dong.

01:15:26.938 --> 01:15:29.148
In the afternoon,
check the downtown area,

01:15:29.229 --> 01:15:32.899
markets, terminals
and other public areas.

01:15:41.063 --> 01:15:44.153
At night, head to
bars, arcades, internet cafes,

01:15:44.229 --> 01:15:45.899
karaokes, and others.

01:15:46.354 --> 01:15:47.944
- Got that?
- Yes, sir!

01:15:55.979 --> 01:15:57.689
Check out Jungho-dong as well.

01:15:58.771 --> 01:16:00.101
That place closed down!

01:16:03.604 --> 01:16:04.654
Damn it.

01:16:06.354 --> 01:16:07.524
Shit.

01:16:11.104 --> 01:16:13.694
Yes, I'm outside, so hurry up.

01:16:14.979 --> 01:16:15.979
Okay.

01:16:16.896 --> 01:16:18.056
When is the bus coming?

01:16:25.271 --> 01:16:27.271
Hey, kid. Come over here.

01:16:29.479 --> 01:16:30.649
Take this then.

01:16:31.688 --> 01:16:33.228
- I'm fine.
- Take it!

01:16:33.729 --> 01:16:35.809
Okay. Thank you.

01:16:37.354 --> 01:16:39.234
What about you though?

01:16:41.146 --> 01:16:42.266
Study hard.

01:16:43.479 --> 01:16:44.599
Hey, Jang Dong-su!

01:16:44.688 --> 01:16:47.098
This isn't the time
to have a team dinner.

01:16:47.188 --> 01:16:49.438
You can't keep them working
on an empty stomach.

01:16:50.229 --> 01:16:51.349
O-seong will be here soon.

01:16:51.813 --> 01:16:52.983
Didn't you bring an umbrella?

01:16:54.938 --> 01:16:55.978
There.

01:16:58.104 --> 01:16:59.564
Don't pretend to be a saint.

01:17:00.188 --> 01:17:02.018
- You there!
- Yes?

01:17:02.188 --> 01:17:06.188
You can't receive items
from strangers like that.

01:17:06.938 --> 01:17:08.148
He's a thug!

01:17:08.229 --> 01:17:10.019
You seem more like one
if you ask me.

01:17:10.104 --> 01:17:11.154
What?

01:17:12.021 --> 01:17:13.151
Don't laugh.

01:17:15.313 --> 01:17:17.063
- Bye!
- Be careful, all right?

01:17:17.229 --> 01:17:18.269
Thank you, sir.

01:17:28.938 --> 01:17:32.598
- Our dicks may be many!
- But we have one heart!

01:17:32.688 --> 01:17:36.098
- Until the end of time!
- We are one!

01:17:36.396 --> 01:17:38.226
- Thank you, Boss!
- Thank you, Boss!

01:17:43.646 --> 01:17:47.396
Hearing that
just made my dick tingle.

01:17:47.479 --> 01:17:48.649
What a fucking life.

01:17:48.729 --> 01:17:51.059
I can't believe
I'm in league with you all.

01:17:52.021 --> 01:17:53.941
Just get your job done.

01:17:54.646 --> 01:17:56.596
How is working for a salary the same

01:17:56.688 --> 01:17:59.058
as risking one's neck every day?

01:18:00.188 --> 01:18:03.518
You're still a fucking thug,
so you can have a drink.

01:18:05.271 --> 01:18:08.851
Just say thank you
when we give you good booze.

01:18:08.938 --> 01:18:11.558
I bring in these liquor,
so drink freely.

01:18:11.646 --> 01:18:14.896
You're involved
in every type of business.

01:18:16.063 --> 01:18:17.273
Do you want to join us?

01:18:18.604 --> 01:18:19.694
Should I?

01:18:20.854 --> 01:18:22.024
You should.

01:18:22.813 --> 01:18:26.353
You look the part
and will go far in a gang.

01:18:26.896 --> 01:18:28.266
Shut your face and have a drink.

01:18:28.479 --> 01:18:29.939
Fine, pour me one.

01:18:39.438 --> 01:18:42.148
Hey, I wasn't turning away
to show respect or anything.

01:18:44.146 --> 01:18:47.896
Shit. My glass is so greasy.

01:18:48.438 --> 01:18:51.228
Dal-ho! I feel shitty,
so sing me a song.

01:18:51.354 --> 01:18:55.104
Detective, did you know
that I was a boy band trainee?

01:18:55.604 --> 01:18:59.774
I'll sing a kick-ass song
for you all.

01:19:00.396 --> 01:19:02.346
Today in Ansan,

01:19:02.438 --> 01:19:04.098
there was a murder...

01:19:04.188 --> 01:19:06.308
Wait, shut it. Turn that up.

01:19:07.063 --> 01:19:10.403
The high school victim
was on her way home

01:19:10.479 --> 01:19:12.269
when she was murdered.

01:19:12.938 --> 01:19:16.648
Considering how young she is,

01:19:17.063 --> 01:19:20.233
the police are ruling out
revenge as a motive,

01:19:20.604 --> 01:19:22.694
and leaning towards
a sexual assault

01:19:22.771 --> 01:19:23.941
or a random attack

01:19:24.021 --> 01:19:25.981
as a potential motive...

01:19:26.063 --> 01:19:27.103
O-seong.

01:19:27.479 --> 01:19:29.349
- Get the hell up!
- Yes, Boss!

01:19:29.438 --> 01:19:31.808
Search every unit
along the Bus 32 route.

01:19:32.188 --> 01:19:33.728
What did we miss?

01:19:33.813 --> 01:19:35.653
North of Dohwa-dong,
Southwest of Wolpo-dong.

01:19:35.729 --> 01:19:37.309
It's 1km from
the central square!

01:19:37.479 --> 01:19:38.479
Move it!

01:19:38.563 --> 01:19:40.733
He's here somewhere,
so stay focused.

01:19:40.813 --> 01:19:42.233
Come up from Daegyeong-dong.

01:19:42.354 --> 01:19:43.854
We'll head down
from Songgeon-dong.

01:19:43.938 --> 01:19:45.648
I'm searching
the central square!

01:19:45.729 --> 01:19:47.649
I think I found him,
It's the Dohwa motel district.

01:19:47.729 --> 01:19:50.439
Gather the boys
and check the cars too.

01:19:50.521 --> 01:19:52.851
Witness found
at the Dohwa motel district.

01:19:52.938 --> 01:19:54.478
Don't just search the motels

01:19:54.563 --> 01:19:57.153
and look into bars
and karaokes too.

01:19:57.354 --> 01:19:59.234
Excuse me, I'm a cop.

01:20:01.479 --> 01:20:03.149
He's staying in Room 304.

01:20:13.563 --> 01:20:14.693
What's going on?

01:20:14.896 --> 01:20:16.976
Tell me! Where is he?

01:20:17.313 --> 01:20:18.943
He left a minute ago.

01:20:19.229 --> 01:20:20.349
Hey, I found him.

01:20:20.479 --> 01:20:23.019
Keep your eyes peeled.
We must get him first.

01:20:23.104 --> 01:20:25.984
Stay in your car
and see if he comes back.

01:20:26.063 --> 01:20:28.773
Don't take any action
and let him walk back here.

01:20:28.854 --> 01:20:30.024
Don't tell me what to do,
you prick.

01:20:32.313 --> 01:20:34.063
Cancel the search party

01:20:34.146 --> 01:20:35.686
and bring
just two more with you here.

01:21:31.396 --> 01:21:32.516
Stay still.

01:22:02.229 --> 01:22:03.269
Get down.

01:22:23.688 --> 01:22:25.098
Nice to meet you again,
little fucker.

01:23:19.979 --> 01:23:21.099
Fucking bastard.

01:23:24.188 --> 01:23:25.558
He drives like a maniac.

01:23:34.979 --> 01:23:36.019
Hey!

01:23:36.854 --> 01:23:38.024
Stop the car, bastard!

01:23:48.313 --> 01:23:49.353
Stop!

01:23:51.229 --> 01:23:52.269
Fuck.

01:23:55.563 --> 01:23:56.693
Stop the car!

01:24:00.438 --> 01:24:01.478
Out of the way!

01:24:14.729 --> 01:24:15.979
Damn them!

01:24:51.229 --> 01:24:52.599
You fucking asshole!

01:24:53.604 --> 01:24:54.774
What was that?

01:24:57.771 --> 01:24:59.481
I was after that bastard!

01:25:00.979 --> 01:25:02.019
Over there.

01:25:02.646 --> 01:25:04.226
Son of a bitch!

01:25:05.396 --> 01:25:06.596
Fucking hell.

01:25:13.604 --> 01:25:14.854
You, go that way.

01:25:15.313 --> 01:25:16.443
Asshole.

01:26:04.354 --> 01:26:05.404
Hey.

01:26:06.063 --> 01:26:06.773
Hey!

01:26:07.646 --> 01:26:08.806
O-seong, no!

01:26:09.438 --> 01:26:11.148
Stay with me, O-seong!

01:26:11.688 --> 01:26:13.228
- O-seong...
- Over there...

01:26:14.354 --> 01:26:15.444
That way!

01:26:18.271 --> 01:26:19.521
Hurry.

01:26:22.021 --> 01:26:23.061
Damn it.

01:26:31.854 --> 01:26:33.104
PANG PANG KARAOKE

01:28:08.604 --> 01:28:09.904
Where are you?

01:28:10.229 --> 01:28:11.519
This fucker is mine now.

01:28:11.604 --> 01:28:13.024
Where the fuck are you?

01:28:20.813 --> 01:28:22.313
Track down Jang's location!

01:28:22.854 --> 01:28:24.654
He took the killer.
Find him fast!

01:28:31.854 --> 01:28:33.234
Fasten your seat belt.

01:28:33.438 --> 01:28:35.478
You can't die before I kill you.

01:28:36.354 --> 01:28:38.484
- Stop at a rest stop.
- What?

01:28:40.229 --> 01:28:41.399
I'm starving.

01:29:03.938 --> 01:29:04.938
This is fun.

01:29:05.729 --> 01:29:07.269
How are we different?

01:29:11.354 --> 01:29:13.524
That's pretty obvious,
don't you think?

01:29:17.438 --> 01:29:19.898
You shouldn't have stabbed me,
you puny jerk.

01:29:22.229 --> 01:29:23.649
Fucker.

01:29:32.563 --> 01:29:33.653
Isn't it fun

01:29:34.063 --> 01:29:36.193
to play with a man's life?

01:29:41.938 --> 01:29:44.348
He drove down to Cheonan.

01:29:44.521 --> 01:29:45.811
He was caught on camera
at the tollgate.

01:29:45.896 --> 01:29:47.056
Son of a bitch.

01:29:50.938 --> 01:29:52.398
Do you know

01:29:52.896 --> 01:29:55.146
what the most
exhilarating part is?

01:29:55.979 --> 01:29:58.059
Shut the fuck up.

01:30:03.229 --> 01:30:04.559
Do you like minced meat?

01:30:06.604 --> 01:30:09.354
I'm going to chop you up nicely

01:30:10.396 --> 01:30:12.346
and spray your guts everywhere.

01:30:13.188 --> 01:30:14.438
Motherfucker.

01:30:16.188 --> 01:30:17.348
It's this moment.

01:30:18.438 --> 01:30:22.438
When life and death
is in your hands.

01:30:22.979 --> 01:30:24.439
Give it a go.

01:30:25.771 --> 01:30:26.901
Get on with it.

01:30:27.688 --> 01:30:29.058
Kill me!

01:30:31.438 --> 01:30:34.228
Do you even listen to yourself?

01:30:35.938 --> 01:30:39.438
Did you think you'd live
after killing all those people?

01:30:39.729 --> 01:30:41.559
That's why you should kill me.

01:30:43.854 --> 01:30:46.814
Try to stay still. I'd rather
not get your blood on me.

01:31:12.229 --> 01:31:13.519
Shit.

01:31:28.979 --> 01:31:30.399
Sorry, buddy,

01:31:32.854 --> 01:31:34.484
but I'm still a cop.

01:31:54.688 --> 01:31:56.518
Nice to meet you, asshole.

01:32:00.271 --> 01:32:05.101
Kang Gyeong-ho, you're
under arrest for homicide.

01:32:10.563 --> 01:32:12.443
Even a devil like you

01:32:13.854 --> 01:32:15.604
can retain an attorney

01:32:16.604 --> 01:32:19.354
and have the right
to remain silent.

01:32:20.438 --> 01:32:23.148
Anything you say can be used

01:32:24.396 --> 01:32:26.766
against you in a court of law.

01:32:28.729 --> 01:32:30.939
If you cannot afford
an attorney,

01:32:31.646 --> 01:32:33.476
one will be appointed to you
in courtesy of

01:32:33.563 --> 01:32:36.773
this nation's taxpayers,
you asshole.

01:32:52.646 --> 01:32:55.476
- What the hell?
- Isn't it obvious?

01:32:56.229 --> 01:32:57.979
He's the serial killer.

01:32:58.771 --> 01:32:59.811
Come here.

01:33:02.021 --> 01:33:03.151
What are you staring at?

01:33:03.604 --> 01:33:04.654
Go home!

01:33:05.188 --> 01:33:06.518
Pack up!

01:33:08.479 --> 01:33:09.729
Come here, you psycho.

01:33:11.646 --> 01:33:13.596
- One moment, please!
- Make way!

01:33:13.688 --> 01:33:15.558
- Let us through.
- Make way!

01:33:15.646 --> 01:33:19.646
While investigating a kidnapping
case from September,

01:33:19.813 --> 01:33:24.403
the Cheonan Police obtained
key evidence that led to Kang.

01:33:24.729 --> 01:33:27.899
He's currently being treated
for minor injuries,

01:33:27.979 --> 01:33:29.729
and he'll be investigated
by the police

01:33:29.813 --> 01:33:33.523
before being handed over
to the prosecutor.

01:33:33.813 --> 01:33:34.853
Let's move on.

01:33:34.938 --> 01:33:39.098
Slot arcades are becoming
a social issue as of late.

01:33:39.313 --> 01:33:41.733
The prosecution traced

01:33:41.813 --> 01:33:44.273
how these arcades
are funding gangsters

01:33:44.646 --> 01:33:48.806
and is currently after
Zeus' gang leader Jang.

01:33:49.354 --> 01:33:52.404
Jang who operates
several dozen slot arcades

01:33:52.854 --> 01:33:56.234
has made a fortune
by illegally modifying

01:33:56.563 --> 01:33:58.813
and distributing
arcade machines.

01:33:59.104 --> 01:34:02.484
However, his current
whereabouts are unknown.

01:34:05.646 --> 01:34:06.896
This is all your doing, isn't it?

01:34:08.646 --> 01:34:09.686
No.

01:34:09.771 --> 01:34:12.731
You convinced the world
that he's the killer,

01:34:13.563 --> 01:34:14.523
but now there's no evidence?

01:34:14.604 --> 01:34:17.234
Everything we have on him
is circumstantial.

01:34:18.104 --> 01:34:19.944
Nothing directly ties him
to the murders.

01:34:20.021 --> 01:34:21.731
Even if I were the judge,

01:34:21.813 --> 01:34:23.903
I wouldn't
give him the death penalty.

01:34:28.229 --> 01:34:29.939
- What's this?
- A knife.

01:34:30.604 --> 01:34:33.984
Yes, one you used
to murder all those people.

01:34:36.646 --> 01:34:38.096
What has been
your concept in life?

01:34:38.979 --> 01:34:41.559
I just can't figure you out.
Do you know why?

01:34:43.563 --> 01:34:45.063
It's because you're not human.

01:34:45.479 --> 01:34:47.019
Then what's yours?

01:34:49.271 --> 01:34:51.981
A good cop? A model citizen?

01:34:53.813 --> 01:34:55.023
You can't answer me, can you?

01:34:55.813 --> 01:34:58.353
Who lives their life
by following a concept?

01:34:59.438 --> 01:35:02.438
We live because we do.

01:35:05.521 --> 01:35:07.311
I wore gloves for my first kill,

01:35:07.688 --> 01:35:10.648
but I couldn't grip
anything properly with them on.

01:35:11.188 --> 01:35:13.058
Each stab should
always be clean.

01:35:14.854 --> 01:35:16.564
That feeling when it goes in?

01:35:17.271 --> 01:35:19.311
You can feel it
from the tips of your fingers.

01:35:20.521 --> 01:35:22.311
I guess
it's something like that.

01:35:24.229 --> 01:35:25.439
And these photos?

01:35:37.438 --> 01:35:38.518
What is it?

01:35:39.313 --> 01:35:41.103
The order's all wrong.

01:35:44.146 --> 01:35:47.096
Besides, how can you say
that these are mine?

01:35:49.146 --> 01:35:52.806
And even if I get
the death penalty,

01:35:54.188 --> 01:35:55.598
you know I won't die.

01:35:56.646 --> 01:35:57.726
You little bastard.

01:35:58.438 --> 01:35:59.848
- I'll kill you!.
- Hey, stop!

01:35:59.938 --> 01:36:00.978
Stop it!

01:36:01.063 --> 01:36:03.733
- Come here. I'll kill you!
- Stop it!

01:36:03.813 --> 01:36:05.313
Don't do it!

01:36:08.646 --> 01:36:12.396
If you sentence me to death
without proper evidence,

01:36:14.021 --> 01:36:15.771
then that's murder.

01:36:16.229 --> 01:36:20.899
The real devils are those who
commit crimes with kind faces.

01:36:21.771 --> 01:36:24.401
Think about it as creators
and enforcers of the law.

01:36:24.479 --> 01:36:26.769
Do you really have that right?

01:36:28.146 --> 01:36:29.846
If you're innocent,

01:36:31.479 --> 01:36:33.519
then I am too.

01:36:43.729 --> 01:36:45.479
Did you state that
you've never seen this knife?

01:36:48.021 --> 01:36:49.061
I did.

01:36:49.146 --> 01:36:53.096
This knife was used
to kill five victims

01:36:53.354 --> 01:36:55.484
between July
and September of 2005.

01:36:55.563 --> 01:36:56.983
Objection, Your Honor.

01:36:57.354 --> 01:36:59.484
The prosecution has not provided
any concrete link

01:36:59.563 --> 01:37:02.903
between the knife
and my client during this trial.

01:37:03.313 --> 01:37:05.693
It cannot be concluded
that the knife belonged to him.

01:37:05.771 --> 01:37:06.811
Yes, you're right.

01:37:08.229 --> 01:37:10.479
This knife has nothing to do
with the defendant...

01:37:11.188 --> 01:37:12.518
at least until now.

01:37:13.646 --> 01:37:18.056
Your Honor, we'd like
to request a sole survivor

01:37:18.313 --> 01:37:23.523
of Kang's vicious knife attack
as the state's next witness.

01:37:24.146 --> 01:37:26.516
Witness, please take the stand.

01:37:52.979 --> 01:37:55.689
You've got balls showing
your face in front of me.

01:37:55.854 --> 01:37:57.484
Damn, you look terrible.

01:38:01.771 --> 01:38:05.811
We pay tax so that you can
arrest and kill those fuckers.

01:38:05.896 --> 01:38:08.556
That's how the law is.

01:38:09.313 --> 01:38:11.853
It arrests people
and punishes them,

01:38:11.938 --> 01:38:15.188
but it also fucking protects us.
That's what it's there for.

01:38:15.271 --> 01:38:18.271
Shut the fuck up.
You should've let me kill him!

01:38:22.688 --> 01:38:25.478
You're my last resort.

01:38:26.188 --> 01:38:29.438
Let's use the law
to kill the bastard.

01:38:31.979 --> 01:38:33.479
Stop your bullshit.

01:38:41.771 --> 01:38:42.811
Turn yourself in.

01:38:43.063 --> 01:38:45.733
Are you out
of your fucking mind?

01:38:49.521 --> 01:38:52.191
- Did you kill Hur Sang-do?
- Yes, I did.

01:38:53.938 --> 01:38:56.398
- Yes, I did.
- Bastard!

01:38:57.521 --> 01:39:00.851
Once this goes public,
you and I are both screwed.

01:39:01.313 --> 01:39:04.653
Don't force me to use this.
All right?

01:39:05.646 --> 01:39:06.846
Surrender and become a witness.

01:39:07.438 --> 01:39:08.768
You're the only witness.

01:39:09.063 --> 01:39:11.153
With you on the witness stand,

01:39:11.229 --> 01:39:13.019
I can link him
to all the murders!

01:39:14.229 --> 01:39:15.269
I'd rather...

01:39:16.771 --> 01:39:17.811
just get screwed together.

01:39:19.104 --> 01:39:22.404
I swear that the evidence that
I shall give shall be the truth,

01:39:22.896 --> 01:39:26.016
the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth, so help me God.

01:39:30.396 --> 01:39:31.436
Your Honor.

01:39:31.813 --> 01:39:34.063
The prosecution's witness is
a wanted head of a gang

01:39:34.146 --> 01:39:35.806
who is accused
of several serious crimes

01:39:35.896 --> 01:39:38.896
including illegal gambling
as well as embezzlement.

01:39:38.979 --> 01:39:41.439
Nothing in the law states that

01:39:41.521 --> 01:39:44.271
a criminal suspect
can't testify in another case.

01:39:44.604 --> 01:39:45.604
I accept.

01:39:46.146 --> 01:39:47.186
Witness,

01:39:47.521 --> 01:39:52.101
how can you verify that you
were stabbed by the defendant?

01:40:00.563 --> 01:40:02.943
Guys like me
who get stabbed regularly

01:40:03.771 --> 01:40:06.941
don't forget our attackers
until the day we die.

01:40:08.563 --> 01:40:10.523
That bastard was the one.

01:40:11.938 --> 01:40:12.978
Here.

01:40:13.813 --> 01:40:19.103
I had this sketch composited
right after I was stabbed.

01:40:22.438 --> 01:40:24.398
Your Honor,
that is simply a drawing

01:40:24.479 --> 01:40:27.189
one drew in
his or her free time.

01:40:27.271 --> 01:40:29.271
It has no legal ground and
cannot be proved scientifically

01:40:29.354 --> 01:40:31.444
and therefore cannot be
admitted as evidence.

01:40:31.521 --> 01:40:32.601
Your Honor,

01:40:33.104 --> 01:40:36.854
this is the witness'
medical record from the hospital

01:40:37.479 --> 01:40:39.479
stating his condition
immediately after the attack.

01:40:39.896 --> 01:40:41.516
The witness is a gang leader.

01:40:41.688 --> 01:40:44.558
Getting stabbed
is normal for him.

01:40:44.896 --> 01:40:46.806
How can that be evidence

01:40:46.896 --> 01:40:48.226
when he could've been
stabbed by someone else?

01:40:48.688 --> 01:40:50.898
He's violating
the defendant's rights

01:40:50.979 --> 01:40:52.599
and is mocking this court!

01:40:52.688 --> 01:40:54.518
Damn, that fucker talks a lot.

01:40:55.521 --> 01:40:56.811
- Hey, Mr. Attorney.
- Witness!

01:40:57.521 --> 01:40:59.521
Would you be able to say that

01:40:59.604 --> 01:41:01.024
if your family
was killed by him?

01:41:01.604 --> 01:41:04.944
The defendant's right?
Nutjobs don't deserve that.

01:41:05.354 --> 01:41:08.404
That fucker
killed people for fun.

01:41:09.104 --> 01:41:12.354
I'm not decent myself,
but he doesn't deserve to live.

01:41:13.229 --> 01:41:14.229
Evidence?

01:41:15.313 --> 01:41:16.603
I'll show you the evidence.

01:41:27.479 --> 01:41:32.019
That night, he forced me out
of my car by crashing into it.

01:41:32.229 --> 01:41:35.149
Then he stabbed me twice
in my side.

01:41:35.979 --> 01:41:38.729
During the struggle,
he stabbed me in the chest.

01:41:38.813 --> 01:41:42.943
I also cut my fingers trying
to grab his knife. See?

01:41:44.979 --> 01:41:47.439
If I were the average man,
I'd be dead too.

01:41:49.188 --> 01:41:51.268
You should have him
take his clothes off too.

01:41:51.646 --> 01:41:54.936
I stabbed his left chest,
so there will be a wound.

01:42:02.521 --> 01:42:05.651
Also check his hands.
You'll find a lot of scars.

01:42:05.896 --> 01:42:07.096
Stabbing is a tricky job,

01:42:07.188 --> 01:42:09.148
so you cut yourself
here and there.

01:42:09.396 --> 01:42:10.936
Your nails get broken too.

01:42:12.813 --> 01:42:14.063
And lastly,

01:42:18.063 --> 01:42:19.733
that fucker wrote this.

01:42:22.229 --> 01:42:24.269
Analyze his handwriting,
and you'll get a match.

01:42:25.604 --> 01:42:27.854
For reference,
Hur Sang-do was my friend.

01:42:27.938 --> 01:42:30.438
HUR WAS KILLED WITH MY KNIFE

01:42:31.604 --> 01:42:34.354
Hur and his lieutenant
are both dead.

01:42:34.688 --> 01:42:36.398
I feel bad for O-seong,

01:42:37.146 --> 01:42:38.896
but if Kang spills everything,

01:42:39.229 --> 01:42:41.099
we can blame O-seong for it.

01:42:43.188 --> 01:42:45.308
HUR WAS KILLED WITH MY KNIFE
BY SOMEONE ELSE

01:42:47.563 --> 01:42:50.023
HUR WAS KILLED WITH MY KNIFE

01:42:50.229 --> 01:42:54.769
Considering the defendant's
extremely violent tendencies,

01:42:55.604 --> 01:42:58.904
wanton disregard for human life,

01:42:59.646 --> 01:43:01.686
and the pain
suffered by the victims,

01:43:02.438 --> 01:43:08.438
his sentence was decided
by weighing all the offenses.

01:43:09.188 --> 01:43:12.058
Ergo, defendant Kang Gyeong-ho

01:43:14.396 --> 01:43:15.686
is sentenced to death.

01:43:22.188 --> 01:43:23.768
61ST POLICE APPRECIATION DAY

01:43:25.104 --> 01:43:26.104
Thank you, sir!

01:43:26.479 --> 01:43:27.519
About-face!

01:43:29.396 --> 01:43:30.516
Salute!

01:43:48.646 --> 01:43:51.766
Boss is coming! Let's greet him!

01:43:52.813 --> 01:43:54.193
- Good afternoon, Boss!
- Good afternoon, Boss!

01:44:55.063 --> 01:44:57.273
- Only on one condition.
- Which is what?

01:44:58.271 --> 01:45:00.691
Have me locked up
in the same prison.

01:45:27.313 --> 01:45:29.653
Three men played the game
with their necks on the line.

01:45:29.938 --> 01:45:31.148
It should damn well be finished.

01:45:50.563 --> 01:45:53.523
DON LEE aka MA DONG SEOK

01:45:56.313 --> 01:45:58.063
KIM MOO YUL

01:46:00.313 --> 01:46:02.693
KIM SUNG KYU
