Looking for Robert Hayes.

00:11:40.881 --> 00:11:43.285
Nah, he's not here.
I'm his brother, Caleb, though.

00:11:43.318 --> 00:11:44.953
Nice to meet you.

00:11:46.487 --> 00:11:47.989
How long you been here?

00:11:48.957 --> 00:11:50.793
Since last fall.

00:11:54.328 --> 00:11:56.564
You boys got your papers
in order?

00:11:56.598 --> 00:12:01.270
Yeah. Yeah, we filed with
the county clerk last August.

00:12:01.303 --> 00:12:03.172
Don't you keep a record
of that stuff?

00:12:03.204 --> 00:12:05.074
Could've saved you a drive
out here, man.

00:12:09.477 --> 00:12:11.447
I want you to go fetch
what I came here for.

00:12:18.987 --> 00:12:22.223
[narrator] <i>In this harsh
and rapidly changing habitat,</i>

00:12:22.256 --> 00:12:26.962
<i>even these regal hunters can be
forced into the role of scavengers,</i>

00:12:26.995 --> 00:12:30.966
<i>and the war between
lions and hyenas over prey</i>

00:12:30.998 --> 00:12:33.468

<i>Before humans evolved

00:12:37.405 --> 00:12:40.208
<i>these beasts ruled this land.</i>

00:12:40.242 --> 00:12:43.212
<i>But these days,
to catch sight of them</i>

00:12:43.245 --> 00:12:46.115
<i>is considered lucky
by many tribes.</i>

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:53.188
A lotta people with deep pockets
getting into this racket.

00:12:53.221 --> 00:12:56.959
A famous boxer, putting his name
on a grow down in the valley.

00:12:56.992 --> 00:12:58.493
I don't watch boxing.

00:13:00.929 --> 00:13:04.867
I thought you people
were born fighters.

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:10.472
Anyway, big corporations
coming in here like that,

00:13:10.505 --> 00:13:12.574
gonna put you small-timers
out of business.

00:13:12.607 --> 00:13:14.509
Ah, we just work here, man.

00:13:14.541 --> 00:13:17.646
Well, with the prices
crashing from last year,

00:13:17.679 --> 00:13:21.083
not much left to pay you guys,
is there?

00:13:21.116 --> 00:13:24.186
215 compliant.
Non-profit back then.

00:13:24.218 --> 00:13:26.622
Everything to code, all organic.

00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:29.858
Yeah, so is dog shit.

00:13:32.928 --> 00:13:34.263
You boys have a nice day.

00:13:41.136 --> 00:13:43.038
[engine starts]

00:13:57.452 --> 00:13:58.654
[exhales]

00:14:07.061 --> 00:14:09.430
- Can you grab the totes?
- Mm-hmm.

00:14:11.031 --> 00:14:12.600
What was he doing here?

00:14:12.633 --> 00:14:14.468
Sheriff clocked us,
but you're so loved up,

00:14:14.501 --> 00:14:16.438
you don't have a clue
what's going on.

00:14:16.471 --> 00:14:18.373
What is your problem, man?
We're above board.

00:14:18.405 --> 00:14:19.974
Yeah, now we are.

00:14:20.007 --> 00:14:21.475
That's why we're sitting on
a bunch of overstock

00:14:21.508 --> 00:14:23.210
so don't be so paranoid.

00:14:23.243 --> 00:14:26.013
- We're a team.
- No, no, no. We were a team.

00:14:26.046 --> 00:14:28.282
Now, that wetback,
her tattoo-necked cousin,

00:14:28.315 --> 00:14:31.552
and his junkie buddy,
that's our fucking team.

00:14:31.585 --> 00:14:34.221
You talk about her like that again,
and I'll hit you in your fucking mouth.

00:14:34.255 --> 00:14:37.626
- Yeah, I'm your fucking family.
- Yeah, so is she.

00:14:37.659 --> 00:14:39.461
She's pregnant, man.

00:14:39.493 --> 00:14:42.497
[scoffs]
Congrats on your anchor baby.

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:52.440
[Swift]
I need to find a place to live.

00:14:52.473 --> 00:14:53.742
I need to find a new job.

00:14:53.775 --> 00:14:55.410
[Ticker] Well, aren't you lucky

00:14:55.443 --> 00:14:56.645
that you're good old friend,
Ticker,

00:14:56.678 --> 00:14:58.413
showed up just in time.

00:14:58.445 --> 00:15:00.014
Well, I'm trying to figure out

00:15:00.048 --> 00:15:02.217
if that's the God's work
or the Devil's work.

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:03.719
[Ticker chuckles]
What's the difference?

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:08.056
These days, I don't know.

00:15:10.657 --> 00:15:12.159
What is this?

00:15:12.193 --> 00:15:14.062
Father O'Connell
finally convert you?

00:15:14.094 --> 00:15:15.696
You know me.

00:15:15.729 --> 00:15:18.432
Chapel was just a quiet place
for me to read my books.

00:15:18.466 --> 00:15:21.136
Ah, bullshit, the man
could preach like a Baptist.

00:15:21.169 --> 00:15:25.506
Yeah, he'd try and lecture me about
God's mercies and bible stories,

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:31.346
but... I merely argued
that if his God existed,

00:15:31.378 --> 00:15:35.016
then the animals in our books
wouldn't be so cruel to each other.

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:39.420
So, I'm curious, how did that
conversation with you and O'Connell go?

00:15:39.453 --> 00:15:41.489
There wasn't much
of a conversation.

00:15:41.522 --> 00:15:44.392
Turns out, I had a lot more
beefs than he had fables.

00:15:44.425 --> 00:15:45.994
You ain't right, man.

00:15:47.094 --> 00:15:50.131
I call it Profane Intervention.

00:15:51.699 --> 00:15:54.269
[rock music plays]

00:15:54.301 --> 00:15:58.139
[indistinct conversation]

[narrator] <i>And although hyenas
have a reputation as thieves...</i>

00:16:02.209 --> 00:16:04.745

<i>The matriarch
both dominates her pack,</i>

[Maria] You need in here?

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:18.093
When are you
going to stop smoking?

00:16:18.126 --> 00:16:21.096
Whenever I'm not surrounded by
all this extra weed.

00:16:21.128 --> 00:16:23.664
Well, once I sell it
then we'll take a vacation.

00:16:23.698 --> 00:16:26.535
Oh, yeah?
Every boy I've ever dated

00:16:26.568 --> 00:16:29.136
says that same thing,
"Waiting for the harvest."

00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:30.704
Never comes.

00:16:30.737 --> 00:16:32.440
Why don't you put on a shirt?

00:16:32.473 --> 00:16:34.208
We got all these thirsty-ass
guys running around here.

00:16:34.242 --> 00:16:35.743
I can't have 'em
seeing all your goods.

00:16:35.776 --> 00:16:37.478
Oh yeah, don't tell me you're
getting jealous?

00:16:37.511 --> 00:16:39.146
I'll make an honest woman
out of you yet.

00:16:39.179 --> 00:16:40.281
Is that right?

00:16:40.314 --> 00:16:41.616
Mm-hm. Then you,
me and the baby,

00:16:41.649 --> 00:16:44.319
we'll take one of those safaris.

00:16:44.352 --> 00:16:46.688
What makes you think I even want
to bring a kid into this, huh?

00:16:48.455 --> 00:16:51.559
You believe everything
happens for a reason.

00:16:51.593 --> 00:16:53.328
[narrator]
<i>And this particular creature...</i>

00:16:53.361 --> 00:16:55.230
- You do?
- Yeah.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:16:59.768
What do you believe in?

00:17:02.136 --> 00:17:04.106
Serendipity.

00:17:04.138 --> 00:17:06.841
Whenever she's around
you do whatever she says.

00:17:06.875 --> 00:17:08.443
Everything's about Maria
with you, huh?

00:17:08.475 --> 00:17:09.877
You fucking jealous?
Is that it?

00:17:09.911 --> 00:17:11.680
No, you're not getting my point,

00:17:11.713 --> 00:17:13.514
what I just said. Everything...

00:17:13.548 --> 00:17:15.517
No, so, whoa... Whoa, whoa,
whoa, let me get this straight;

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:17.452
I invested my college fund
into this,

00:17:17.484 --> 00:17:19.253
now you're just gonna
switch it up on me?

00:17:19.287 --> 00:17:20.689
We could triple our money.
It was just an idea.

00:17:20.722 --> 00:17:22.190
Yeah, whose idea?

00:17:22.223 --> 00:17:23.758
[Maria]
It's just a little weed, Caleb.

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:27.229
Never hurt nobody,
no matter what state it's in.

00:17:27.261 --> 00:17:31.867
Hey, uh, not to intrude, but we could
get a couple phony UPS trucks and...

00:17:31.899 --> 00:17:34.869
You don't own any of this, so,
you don't have a say. I'm sorry.

00:17:34.903 --> 00:17:37.771
Why you walking
through our bedroom?

00:17:37.805 --> 00:17:39.441
My bad, man,
it was just quicker.

00:17:39.473 --> 00:17:41.643
Walk around next time.

00:17:41.675 --> 00:17:44.479
Yo, I can take the drive.
I'm down to do it.

00:17:44.511 --> 00:17:48.684
No, I invested in a business,
not a fucking cartel. Fuck this!

00:17:50.652 --> 00:17:52.420
You promised.

00:17:52.453 --> 00:17:53.689
This little bitch.

00:17:55.956 --> 00:17:57.626
You know, it's not worth
risk right now,

00:17:57.658 --> 00:17:59.293
not with the cop
that just came by.

00:17:59.327 --> 00:18:01.829
Come on, you know he's
just looking to get greased.

00:18:01.863 --> 00:18:05.200
No, I made up my mind.
We're not doing it.

00:18:07.402 --> 00:18:08.636
Thank you.

00:18:15.409 --> 00:18:17.878
You shouldn't have
said that shit, man.

00:18:17.912 --> 00:18:20.249
Whatever, he was already
being a little pussy.

00:18:21.549 --> 00:18:24.519
I fucking knew it.

00:18:24.551 --> 00:18:26.453
It's time to go now,
but you know that, right?

00:18:26.486 --> 00:18:28.355
It's... it's time to go.

00:18:28.388 --> 00:18:31.292
I'm gonna stay.

00:18:31.326 --> 00:18:34.930
Adder, for once, cut your losses.
Ticker's a fucking psycho.

00:18:34.963 --> 00:18:37.398
All the more reason
to get the money.

00:18:37.432 --> 00:18:39.300
We busted our asses
all fucking season.

00:18:39.334 --> 00:18:42.203
Nah, man.
I'm packing my shit.

00:18:42.236 --> 00:18:44.238
I'm not trying
to bring this to my cousin.

00:18:44.271 --> 00:18:46.308
I gotta go back
to the crib real quick.

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:49.910
I'll call you
and we'll talk it out.

00:18:49.944 --> 00:18:52.313
Yo, I don't want you bringing it
to her either, all right!

[Rob] <i>Stupid! One little slip up
and we're fucked.</i>

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:05.727
Everything that I built is over.

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:08.930
And you won't even let
someone else take the risk?

00:19:08.963 --> 00:19:11.266
It's not worth to risk.

00:19:11.299 --> 00:19:13.335
[scoffs]

00:19:13.367 --> 00:19:16.704
They're not afraid,
they know what they're doing.

00:19:16.738 --> 00:19:18.740
It's not about that.
I made a promise.

00:19:18.772 --> 00:19:21.242
Yeah, well, so much for this...

00:19:21.276 --> 00:19:22.777
What, you don't think I'd give
whatever to protect my kid?

00:19:22.809 --> 00:19:24.346
Give what, Rob?! What?!

00:19:24.378 --> 00:19:26.548
You don't have anything.
You're broke.

00:19:32.052 --> 00:19:34.755
You know...

00:19:34.789 --> 00:19:40.828
...my dad died in the desert...
so my mom and I would have a better life.

00:19:43.897 --> 00:19:46.467
Me and Caleb stashed some cash
from the last harvest

00:19:46.501 --> 00:19:48.470
before the price dropped.

00:19:48.502 --> 00:19:50.472
All we have to do is wash it,
and we'll be fine.

00:19:50.504 --> 00:19:51.772
Everything's gonna be okay.

00:19:55.309 --> 00:19:56.712
Why didn't you tell me?

00:19:58.913 --> 00:20:00.315
I'm telling you now.

00:20:05.686 --> 00:20:06.721

These things just work
themselves out.

00:20:10.992 --> 00:20:12.059
Just... No.

00:20:12.092 --> 00:20:14.461
Look, no, look, look...

00:20:14.494 --> 00:20:16.665
We can't tell
your cousin just yet.

00:20:16.697 --> 00:20:20.768
Let's just keep it between us
until we figure things out, okay?

[sniffing]

00:20:26.741 --> 00:20:31.413
Well, tell Rob he can trim that
shit himself then!

00:20:31.445 --> 00:20:34.415
All right, all right.
All right, all right, all right!

00:20:34.448 --> 00:20:36.884
I'm coming back now.

00:20:36.917 --> 00:20:38.552

- Fuck!

00:21:03.911 --> 00:21:05.380
Who the fuck are you?

00:21:19.594 --> 00:21:21.363
I didn't lose your base, man.

00:21:21.396 --> 00:21:24.332
It was...
It was Diego, he burned it.

00:21:25.899 --> 00:21:27.968
[Ticker]
All right.

00:21:28.001 --> 00:21:30.605
Where is the cheeky bastard?

00:21:30.637 --> 00:21:32.941
He found out you were out.
Skipped town.

00:21:32.973 --> 00:21:36.043
I stayed because I'm gonna
pay off our debt.

00:21:36.077 --> 00:21:39.681
Aw...
That was awfully good of you.

00:21:39.713 --> 00:21:44.519
Smart, too. You should
never run from a predator.

00:21:44.551 --> 00:21:46.620
Let's them know you're prey.

00:21:46.654 --> 00:21:50.125
Now, where's my 50 G's?

00:21:50.157 --> 00:21:55.062
Fifty?
We owe you 15, man.

00:21:55.096 --> 00:21:58.767
Well, the clock's been
tick-tick-ticking, hasn't it?

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.868
[wincing]

00:22:00.902 --> 00:22:02.971
Yo, Tick, what are you doing?

00:22:03.003 --> 00:22:05.506
I... I can get it.
More than that.

00:22:10.478 --> 00:22:11.546
My bosses grow!

00:22:11.578 --> 00:22:12.880
He's... he's... he's got

00:22:12.914 --> 00:22:15.116
five times
more than that up there.

00:22:15.148 --> 00:22:17.084
Oh, yeah?

00:22:17.117 --> 00:22:20.422
Mate, they're just criminals.

00:22:20.454 --> 00:22:23.857
They're not gonna
call the police on you.

- If there's as much as he says there is...
- There is!

00:22:26.092 --> 00:22:28.529
If there is...

00:22:29.963 --> 00:22:31.399
...you can have half.

00:22:35.569 --> 00:22:36.570
All right.

00:22:44.678 --> 00:22:46.714
[dog barking in distance]

00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:05.867
[Caleb] I wanna thank you
for what you did earlier.

00:23:06.834 --> 00:23:08.503
It means a lot.

00:23:08.536 --> 00:23:10.472
Don't worry about it.

00:23:10.504 --> 00:23:13.574
When I made t-shirts,
you wore every one of them.

00:23:15.776 --> 00:23:19.047
When I tried landscaping,
you picked up a shovel.

00:23:19.079 --> 00:23:22.850
Yeah, I'm still shoveling.

00:23:22.884 --> 00:23:26.154
Yeah, but I didn't want you following
me back here, you know that, right?

00:23:26.186 --> 00:23:28.155
I don't regret it.

00:23:28.188 --> 00:23:30.657
But you should be
figuring it out for yourself.

00:23:30.691 --> 00:23:32.626
What does that mean?

00:23:32.659 --> 00:23:35.929
You don't need this bullshit.

00:23:35.963 --> 00:23:38.832
You can go back to school.
I can cash you out.

00:23:38.866 --> 00:23:41.102
I don't care about any of that.

00:23:41.135 --> 00:23:45.106
All I care about is this season
being over and us being good again.

00:23:45.138 --> 00:23:48.042
This game's not for everybody,
you have to live this shit.

00:23:57.551 --> 00:23:59.119
Then we'll do like you said.

00:24:01.856 --> 00:24:03.592
We'll cross state lines.

00:24:07.161 --> 00:24:09.164
I don't even know
if I want to do that anymore.

00:24:11.698 --> 00:24:13.000
[exhales]

00:24:13.033 --> 00:24:14.234
I just want me, her and the baby

00:24:14.268 --> 00:24:15.604
to have a real spot, you know?

00:24:18.705 --> 00:24:20.175
Yo, yo, Maria?

00:24:29.149 --> 00:24:30.651
[door opens]

00:24:32.587 --> 00:24:34.955
[Swift] So, it's definitely
just the three of them up there.

00:24:34.989 --> 00:24:37.225
The kid brother,
the guy and his girl?

00:24:37.258 --> 00:24:39.694
Mm-hm. Yeah.

00:24:39.726 --> 00:24:41.261
Yeah, that's some bullshit.

00:24:41.294 --> 00:24:43.096
Hey, yo, Tick,
let this motherfucker know about

00:24:43.129 --> 00:24:44.832
the bird you was
telling me about.

00:24:45.765 --> 00:24:47.535
The shrike.

00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:55.008
It's a cute little thing,
about the size of a robin.

00:24:55.041 --> 00:25:00.615
Has a black stripe across its eyes,
makes it look like a wee bandit.

00:25:00.647 --> 00:25:02.082
Stop me if you know
what it does.

00:25:04.117 --> 00:25:05.220
Do you know?

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:07.021
No.

00:25:07.922 --> 00:25:09.591
It plucks...

00:25:11.925 --> 00:25:17.831
...bugs, mice, other little
birds out of their homes

00:25:17.865 --> 00:25:21.036
and impales them
on thorns and barb wire.

00:25:22.203 --> 00:25:25.607
Snakes, too.
I gotta take a piss.

00:25:31.011 --> 00:25:33.013
[door shuts]

00:25:33.047 --> 00:25:36.017
[Ticker]
Aye, snakes, too.

00:25:38.152 --> 00:25:40.989
'Cause nobody likes a fucking
snake, do they?

00:25:49.664 --> 00:25:51.266
What do you think it does then?

00:25:55.101 --> 00:25:56.403
Eats them.

00:25:56.436 --> 00:25:57.938
Sometimes, aye.

00:26:05.245 --> 00:26:08.081
[whispering]
What the fuck are you doing?

00:26:08.115 --> 00:26:14.422
Other times, it likes to take
its prey apart piece by piece,

00:26:14.454 --> 00:26:20.361
so it can make these wee trophy
displays, to attract mates.

00:26:38.279 --> 00:26:40.048
It's just the way they are.

00:26:41.115 --> 00:26:42.183
[car door shuts]

00:26:46.052 --> 00:26:47.755
Way they was made.

00:26:50.758 --> 00:26:54.763
So, one last time;
no alarms, and no surprises.

00:26:56.496 --> 00:26:59.399
It's up there
about a half-mile on the right.

00:26:59.433 --> 00:27:01.435
[engine starts]

00:27:09.476 --> 00:27:11.979
[Caleb]
Yeah, about that.

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:16.283
I'm really sorry
for what I said earlier.

00:27:17.283 --> 00:27:18.419
I didn't mean it.

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:22.089
I'll try to be nicer, I promise.

00:27:23.223 --> 00:27:24.925
It's not about that.

00:27:24.959 --> 00:27:27.795
You and Maria are gonna be fine.

00:27:27.828 --> 00:27:30.831
<i>And for the record,
she suggested giving you a bigger cut.</i>

00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:41.275
Hey, cuz. I got... I gotta go.
I can't stay here.

00:27:41.308 --> 00:27:43.310
Where are you running off to?

00:27:43.344 --> 00:27:46.414
I'm not running.
I just...

00:27:46.446 --> 00:27:48.448
I can't be here.

00:27:48.482 --> 00:27:49.783
Why?

00:27:51.085 --> 00:27:52.087
[speaking Spanish]

00:27:54.053 --> 00:27:55.922
This season's all messed up,
you know,

00:27:55.955 --> 00:27:58.827
and I'm not just gonna sit
around for it to get worse, so...

00:28:00.161 --> 00:28:02.163
[speaking Spanish]

00:28:08.168 --> 00:28:10.070
I've done this
for you twice, now.

00:28:10.104 --> 00:28:11.439
Can you please just be cool?

00:28:11.472 --> 00:28:13.307
You think I want
to be on this farm?

00:28:13.339 --> 00:28:15.242
You always have
a place here, man.

00:28:15.276 --> 00:28:16.377
This is our home.

00:28:18.279 --> 00:28:21.049
- Gonna be an uncle.
- Yeah, you are.

00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:27.989
[bird chirping]

00:28:48.509 --> 00:28:49.810
Let's go.

00:28:59.386 --> 00:29:02.423
Cut through there...
bring us right behind the compound.

00:29:04.258 --> 00:29:06.561
Yeah, okay, motherfucker.

00:29:06.594 --> 00:29:08.163
Remember what I said in the car.

00:29:28.182 --> 00:29:30.184
What's with all this?

00:29:30.216 --> 00:29:32.352
- Just for show.
- Just for show?

00:29:34.954 --> 00:29:37.391
Well, if that's how it's gonna be,
man, don't leave me empty-handed.

00:29:42.363 --> 00:29:44.065
[Ticker]
Get the fuck out of here.

00:29:45.198 --> 00:29:46.433
Fuckin' clown.

00:29:50.471 --> 00:29:53.974
[Caleb] For the record,
I'm not taking a bigger cut.

00:29:54.008 --> 00:29:57.044
You gotta fix the house up,
properly this time.

00:29:57.077 --> 00:29:58.880
All right.

00:29:58.913 --> 00:30:01.015
I'll fix the tree house
before I go.

00:30:02.549 --> 00:30:04.618
She gotta learn
how to walk first.

00:30:06.353 --> 00:30:07.889
She?

00:30:07.922 --> 00:30:09.390
I just got a feeling,
you know.

00:30:22.269 --> 00:30:26.540
[Adder] Brother usually chills in his
tent at the base right down there.

00:30:29.409 --> 00:30:32.612
[Ticker]
You two circle around back.

00:30:32.646 --> 00:30:36.184
I'll take the kiddie's place,
we'll meet up front.

00:30:50.597 --> 00:30:53.200
Don't worry about
the fucking gun, worry about me.

00:30:53.232 --> 00:30:54.269
Let's go.

00:31:03.743 --> 00:31:06.213
Just pack a bag,
you can come with me.

00:31:06.245 --> 00:31:09.249
[scoffs] You don't even have the
balls to tell me why you're leaving.

00:31:16.690 --> 00:31:23.097
That guy me and Adder burned...
he's out, and I can't risk him finding me.

00:31:29.203 --> 00:31:32.339
[Ticker]
Cunt said he'd be here.

00:31:32.373 --> 00:31:35.176
Fine.
If you're scared then just go.

00:31:35.209 --> 00:31:38.980
[speaking Spanish]

00:31:39.012 --> 00:31:42.215
I wanna stay...
I wanna stay with you.

00:31:42.249 --> 00:31:44.117
I just can't.

00:31:44.151 --> 00:31:45.620
[speaking Spanish]

00:31:48.355 --> 00:31:50.290
What's going on?

00:31:50.323 --> 00:31:54.494
Says he's leaving.
No endurance for it.

00:31:54.528 --> 00:31:56.597
Look, I meant what I said.
If that means you're done here...

00:31:56.629 --> 00:31:58.366
It is what it is, man.

00:31:58.398 --> 00:32:00.968
Uh, can I take a few a totes
as payment, or what?

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:09.577
Don't look at me.
I'd make him beg for it.

00:32:13.646 --> 00:32:14.715
Take three.

00:32:27.627 --> 00:32:30.330
I thought he was just frustrated
waiting on the yield.

00:32:31.632 --> 00:32:35.436
No...
He insists he's in trouble.

00:32:40.174 --> 00:32:41.475
Could've come to me about it.

00:32:42.475 --> 00:32:44.044
I coulda helped.

00:32:44.078 --> 00:32:46.747
I mean, at least,
I coulda paid the difference.

00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:49.250
It's okay, babe.
Don't worry about it.

00:32:54.855 --> 00:32:56.424
Talked to Caleb.

00:32:56.456 --> 00:32:58.358
Yeah, about what?

00:32:59.659 --> 00:33:02.062
About possibly,
uh, buying him out.

00:33:06.099 --> 00:33:07.767
How'd he take it?

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:09.502
Surprisingly well.

00:33:09.536 --> 00:33:10.605
<i>Better than I thought.</i>

00:33:14.441 --> 00:33:17.278
I guess it's gonna be
just you and me from now on.

00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:18.478
We'll take care of everything.

00:33:22.648 --> 00:33:23.818
You gonna trim?

00:33:23.850 --> 00:33:25.351
I can trim.

00:33:25.385 --> 00:33:27.121
I'd rather learn
how to grow though.

00:33:28.688 --> 00:33:30.357
When you gonna learn
how to do that?

00:33:32.291 --> 00:33:34.761
Mm... I was thinking
you could teach me now.

00:33:36.363 --> 00:33:38.265
- Now?
- Yes.

00:33:38.298 --> 00:33:39.367
Like, right now?

00:33:40.634 --> 00:33:41.669
Okay.

00:34:07.828 --> 00:34:09.330
Mm...

00:34:09.363 --> 00:34:10.631
It's so sweet.

00:34:12.332 --> 00:34:16.737
When the females flower
they grow these colas,

00:34:16.769 --> 00:34:19.572
which are a cluster of buds.

00:34:19.606 --> 00:34:25.513
When the males flower it produces
pollen, which impregnates those colas.

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:28.182
Sounds familiar.

00:34:28.214 --> 00:34:30.783
[chuckles]
Yeah, but we don't want that

00:34:30.816 --> 00:34:33.153
because all that does
is give them seeds, right?

00:34:38.792 --> 00:34:40.928
- [Maria] <i>Mm.</i>
- [Rob] <i>So, to get the product right,</i>

00:34:40.961 --> 00:34:46.234
we cut down all the males before
they can ruin the females.

00:34:47.367 --> 00:34:49.736
So, we kill off all the males.

00:34:49.769 --> 00:34:51.638
I think
I'm starting to like this.

00:34:51.671 --> 00:34:53.406
You would,
you smoke enough of it.

00:35:01.314 --> 00:35:03.251
Jesus Christ.

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:09.723
They storing all this shit
for a reason?

00:35:09.756 --> 00:35:14.728
[Adder] Too much product on the West Coast.
Can't shift it.

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:17.730
So, at this point, there's not
much to do besides pull the tents

00:35:17.763 --> 00:35:20.434
so we can change
their day and night cycle.

00:35:20.466 --> 00:35:25.838
- So, we just feed them, watch them grow and then harvest them.
- Pretty much.

00:35:25.872 --> 00:35:28.943
[Swift] I can get six G's
for one of these in Detroit.

00:35:28.975 --> 00:35:31.178
[Ticker]
Detroit's a long ways from here.

00:35:31.979 --> 00:35:33.446
Where is everybody?

00:35:33.479 --> 00:35:35.415
[Swift]
Who cares. Where's the paper?

00:35:35.448 --> 00:35:36.950
[Adder] It's... It's gotta
be in the private room

00:35:36.984 --> 00:35:38.485
but they have the key.

00:35:38.517 --> 00:35:40.720
[Ticker] Oh, that's okay.

00:35:40.754 --> 00:35:42.756
Brought my lock-pick.

00:35:42.789 --> 00:35:44.658
We can't open up a safe
without them anyhow.

00:35:44.691 --> 00:35:46.526
Let's just find the kid.

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:49.296
[Adder] They have to be
in one of the greenhouses.

00:35:49.328 --> 00:35:51.798
[Ticker]
Aye. They better be.

00:36:02.676 --> 00:36:05.546
The nursery is where
the real work is.

00:36:05.578 --> 00:36:08.615
The younger they are,
then the more you have to nurture them.

00:36:08.649 --> 00:36:09.951
But I like that part though.

00:36:16.689 --> 00:36:19.260
- You're gonna be such a good dad.
- Oh, yeah?

00:36:37.343 --> 00:36:38.612
[moaning]

00:36:48.522 --> 00:36:51.292
[Swift]
Ohh... I missed you.

00:36:58.597 --> 00:37:00.267
[Ticker]
Where are youse?

00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:05.472
Shit! Hey, don't fucking move!

00:37:05.504 --> 00:37:07.073
[groans]

00:37:07.106 --> 00:37:08.541
[Adder] No, no, no, no, no,
he's with me!

00:37:08.575 --> 00:37:09.977
He's with me.

00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:12.780
- [groaning]
- Adder? Who the fuck is that?

00:37:12.812 --> 00:37:13.881
What's going on?

00:37:17.783 --> 00:37:19.986
There's more here than we
thought. We're gonna roll 'em.

00:37:24.691 --> 00:37:27.060
[moaning]

00:37:27.093 --> 00:37:28.896
Motherfucker,
you said nobody else was here.

00:37:31.064 --> 00:37:33.000
There wasn't supposed to be.

00:37:33.033 --> 00:37:36.337
[Ticker] Oh, you're running?
You better fucking run.

00:37:36.370 --> 00:37:38.806
Ticker is gonna fuck you up.

00:37:38.839 --> 00:37:40.741
Ticker's here?

00:37:40.774 --> 00:37:42.476
[Ticker]
Run. Run.

00:37:42.508 --> 00:37:44.844
- [Adder] Yeah.
- Where's Maria?

00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:48.949
[moaning]

00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:52.385
[Ticker] Fuck!

00:37:52.419 --> 00:37:54.821
There he is. There he is.

00:37:56.756 --> 00:37:58.059
Oh, hello, pal.

Aren't you a rare creature?

00:39:21.841 --> 00:39:24.077
No way this is

Well, go on then.

Some cunts gotta be told
to do every little thing, huh?

00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:31.024
This whole deal will go a lot
better for you and your brother

If the next thing...

that safe, then the next thing in it,

What the fuck was that?!
Huh?

What's with all this
JCat shit, huh?!

You tryin' to get us sent to death

[Swift]
So, you fucking kill him?

It's gonna be all right, Caleb.

He owed me.

No, go on and get that truck.

All right, everybody, listen up.

Your friend got stupid,
and then he got dead.

00:48:31.524 --> 00:48:33.560
But nobody else
needs to get hurt.

00:48:33.593 --> 00:48:36.261

then we're gone.

Did you just not hear what the
fuck I said about being stupid?

00:48:41.801 --> 00:48:45.171
This is all we got, man.
I know it's not a lot.

Nah. Somebody's lying.

He's gonna kill us all anyway.

Probably you, too.

00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:49.769
Think about it.
He's already killed my cousin.

00:49:49.801 --> 00:49:51.637
He's got nothing to lose.

00:49:51.671 --> 00:49:54.573
Do you really think he's gonna
share that money with you?

00:49:58.644 --> 00:50:01.080
Baby girl, let me let you
in on a little secret.

00:50:01.113 --> 00:50:02.816
What?

00:50:02.848 --> 00:50:06.352
He ain't my problem, he's yours.

No, he's right. He's right.
He's right.

Everybody, shut the fuck up!

It's not right.

00:50:33.513 --> 00:50:36.450
Why did he not send that skinny
wee poof to move the truck?

00:50:39.252 --> 00:50:41.388
[Swift]
Get up, man. Get up!

00:50:42.421 --> 00:50:43.890
Get the fuck up!

Where is it?!

Caleb, I already told him
it was in the tool shed,

00:50:52.497 --> 00:50:55.667
just tell him
where you moved it!

You should leave
before the cops come, man.

I know you didn't
call the cops, man.

He must think
he's smarter than you.

00:51:58.497 --> 00:51:59.699
Stop.

00:51:59.731 --> 00:52:01.266
- [grunts]
- [yelling]

00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:04.203
Caleb! Caleb! You motherfucker!

00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:07.373
You son of a bitch!

00:52:23.589 --> 00:52:25.425
Look what youse made me do.

00:52:27.493 --> 00:52:30.463
Go take care of that body out
front, and load the truck.

00:52:47.946 --> 00:52:50.883
[Adder] You know she's right,
this is fucked!

00:52:50.915 --> 00:52:52.651
[Swift]
Is that money up there or not?

00:52:52.685 --> 00:52:54.254
[Adder]
Somewhere, but fuck this.

00:52:54.287 --> 00:52:56.289
Let's just roll
before the cops come.

00:52:56.321 --> 00:52:58.323
Look, I know you don't
want to go back inside.

00:52:58.356 --> 00:53:00.592
[Swift] I ain't leaving here
empty-handed.

00:53:00.626 --> 00:53:02.894
[Adder] I can move the weed,
get us paid.

00:53:02.928 --> 00:53:05.598
Come on, fuck the safe,
it'll take too much time.

00:53:05.631 --> 00:53:08.635
[Swift]
Nah, Ticker won't go for it.

00:53:16.709 --> 00:53:18.278
[Adder]
You got a gun.

00:53:18.310 --> 00:53:19.511
You could drop
that crazy fuck

00:53:19.544 --> 00:53:20.879
before he even knew
what was going on.

00:53:20.912 --> 00:53:21.914
[Swift]
Motherfucker, I don't know you,

00:53:21.946 --> 00:53:23.349
and I don't trust you.

00:53:25.751 --> 00:53:26.986
No, no.

00:53:27.019 --> 00:53:28.354
[Ticker grunts]

00:53:28.386 --> 00:53:30.390
Oh, by the way,

00:53:30.423 --> 00:53:33.359
great idea
sticking youse in there.

00:53:33.392 --> 00:53:34.527
The closet.

00:53:35.894 --> 00:53:38.363
[door creaks]

00:53:38.397 --> 00:53:40.500
I don't know where it is!

00:53:40.533 --> 00:53:45.038
Well, maybe, if you think really
hard, you'll be able to guess.

00:53:47.039 --> 00:53:50.577
You just killed the only person
who knew where it is.

00:53:53.546 --> 00:53:55.415
No, no, no...

00:54:05.658 --> 00:54:08.694
[Adder] You... you really think
he's gonna give you half?

00:54:08.727 --> 00:54:11.496
[Swift] You ain't never
been on the inside, I can tell.

00:54:11.530 --> 00:54:13.732
[Adder] Yeah, yeah,
that's right, 'cause I'm smart.

00:54:13.765 --> 00:54:15.468
[Swift] Nah, that ain't it at
all.

00:54:15.501 --> 00:54:16.903
You're just too much
of a coward pussy

00:54:16.935 --> 00:54:19.004
to do anything worth
getting sent up for anyway.

00:54:19.037 --> 00:54:22.841
Ticker's batshit crazy, I'll give you
that, but he ain't no liar.

00:54:22.874 --> 00:54:24.510
He'll give me mine.

00:54:24.542 --> 00:54:27.747
[Adder]
Yeah, yeah, good luck with that.

00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:30.050
You better get your ass
inside that damn room.

00:54:43.629 --> 00:54:47.400
[panting]

00:54:47.432 --> 00:54:49.368
Please, don't hurt her.

00:54:49.401 --> 00:54:51.503
Hurt her?

00:54:51.537 --> 00:54:53.406
[clicking tongue]

00:54:53.439 --> 00:54:58.411
I'm going to make her feel
really... really good.

00:55:00.613 --> 00:55:01.915
Please, she's pregnant.

00:55:05.551 --> 00:55:06.686
Is that right?

00:55:11.756 --> 00:55:16.929
When a lion takes over another's
pride, you know what he does?

00:55:18.196 --> 00:55:19.765
Do you know?

00:55:20.633 --> 00:55:21.935
First thing:

00:55:25.838 --> 00:55:29.908
He kills all his rival's cubs.

00:55:31.577 --> 00:55:35.615
It forces the females into heat.

00:55:35.647 --> 00:55:40.053
Can he help but mate with them,
over and over again?

00:55:53.832 --> 00:55:55.635
I almost forgot I gave you that.

00:56:00.972 --> 00:56:02.141
Thanks, mate.

00:56:09.214 --> 00:56:10.716
Come on, then, love.

00:56:10.749 --> 00:56:12.984
[sighs]
Let's have some fun.

00:56:13.017 --> 00:56:14.086
Come on.

00:56:14.118 --> 00:56:15.754
[shrieking]

00:56:15.787 --> 00:56:19.691
No! Stop! Stop!
No! No! No!

00:56:19.725 --> 00:56:21.694
[shrieking]

00:56:23.761 --> 00:56:25.731
[Maria] Baby, do something!

00:56:26.731 --> 00:56:27.900
Baby!

00:56:31.669 --> 00:56:33.071
[Swift]
Then you got two choices:

00:56:33.104 --> 00:56:34.940
Tell us where that safe is,

00:56:34.973 --> 00:56:36.975
or beg me to put you
out of your misery.

00:56:37.008 --> 00:56:39.745
Huh?
What's it gonna be?!

00:56:42.647 --> 00:56:44.950
Let's go!
Gotta show you something.

00:56:44.984 --> 00:56:46.619
The cave! The cave!

00:56:46.651 --> 00:56:48.620
[Swift]
Tick!

00:56:48.653 --> 00:56:50.956
The cave! He just found it!
It's gotta be there!

00:56:50.990 --> 00:56:52.024
I know it's there!

00:56:54.593 --> 00:56:56.629
Take your time.

00:56:56.662 --> 00:56:59.165
It's in the cave.
It's in the cave.

00:56:59.198 --> 00:57:00.732
- It's in there.
- [Swift] Get up.

00:57:05.271 --> 00:57:06.839
[Maria] Let me go!

00:57:37.269 --> 00:57:38.638
Come on in.

00:57:44.642 --> 00:57:46.011
Enjoy the show.

00:58:44.336 --> 00:58:47.173
[Swift] You seem like the smart one.
Keep it that way,

00:58:47.205 --> 00:58:48.941
and there's chance
you'll survive all this.

00:58:48.973 --> 00:58:50.242
No, there ain't.

00:58:52.810 --> 00:58:55.048
Just let my kid
have that chance.

00:58:58.017 --> 00:58:59.018
Keep walking.

00:59:07.959 --> 00:59:09.361
Oh...

00:59:10.796 --> 00:59:12.932
I guess you're not in heat yet.

00:59:15.066 --> 00:59:18.203
Might have to
rip out that cub, hey?

00:59:18.236 --> 00:59:21.039
You always talk this much
before you fuck?

00:59:24.276 --> 00:59:27.213
[laughing]

00:59:29.314 --> 00:59:31.017
Where did they find you?

00:59:37.890 --> 00:59:39.325
[engine shuts off]

00:59:39.357 --> 00:59:41.227
[radio chatter indistinct]

00:59:54.439 --> 00:59:56.309
[speaking Spanish]

01:00:05.184 --> 01:00:07.086
[stuttering]

01:00:07.118 --> 01:00:10.022
Did she just...
Did you just call me a wolf?

01:00:13.758 --> 01:00:18.130
Prison wolf. Straight boy
who fucks ass inside.

01:00:20.798 --> 01:00:22.033
[knocking]

01:00:22.066 --> 01:00:24.703
But you ain't even that,
are you?

01:00:30.408 --> 01:00:31.477
[sheriff]
County sheriff.

01:00:31.510 --> 01:00:33.078
Get that fuck!

01:00:45.289 --> 01:00:46.958
[knocking]

01:00:52.030 --> 01:00:55.033
Take off your clothes.

01:01:14.385 --> 01:01:16.121
County sheriff, open up!

01:01:19.024 --> 01:01:21.894
What's with all the noise? We're...
we're trying to work here.

01:01:23.562 --> 01:01:25.164
Slow.

01:01:25.196 --> 01:01:26.298
Get out here.

01:01:30.068 --> 01:01:31.203
[Swift]
Keep walking.

01:01:33.071 --> 01:01:34.906
How much further?

01:01:34.939 --> 01:01:37.342
It's a little ways.

01:01:37.376 --> 01:01:40.146
I heard how you reacted
when Diego got shot.

01:01:42.548 --> 01:01:45.383
Where's the owner
and his brother?

01:01:45.417 --> 01:01:47.219
Uh, owner is out,

01:01:47.252 --> 01:01:50.757
and his brother kinda does
his own thing, so, I don't know.

01:01:52.557 --> 01:01:53.760
You sure about that?

01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:59.932
I don't know what you're getting
at, sheriff, but, uh, to be honest,

01:01:59.964 --> 01:02:03.368
I'm a... I'm a little stoned.

01:02:03.401 --> 01:02:05.570
You led my little brother
right to him, man.

01:02:05.604 --> 01:02:07.839
He was just a kid.

01:02:07.872 --> 01:02:10.141
Look, the last thing I
wanted

01:02:10.175 --> 01:02:11.810
was for anybody to get hurt.

01:02:11.843 --> 01:02:13.812
Now, I'm sorry
about your brother.

01:02:13.845 --> 01:02:15.814
But there's nothing
we can do about that now.

01:02:15.847 --> 01:02:17.015
Now move.

01:02:18.383 --> 01:02:19.385
Move!

01:02:21.118 --> 01:02:23.222
See, I got a call from up here.

01:02:23.254 --> 01:02:25.457
More than one actually.

01:02:25.490 --> 01:02:28.861
Number's come up
registered to Hayes.

01:02:28.894 --> 01:02:30.361
Oh, Caleb, yeah, yeah.

01:02:30.394 --> 01:02:32.163
He said he was
trying to call you about that,

01:02:32.196 --> 01:02:33.499
uh, that, paper work.

01:02:33.531 --> 01:02:35.901
Had some questions.

01:02:35.934 --> 01:02:37.803
He called 911 for that?

01:02:39.437 --> 01:02:41.973
The dispatch thought
she heard gunshots.

01:02:43.975 --> 01:02:46.912
Maybe he was
reporting some poachers.

01:02:46.944 --> 01:02:48.914
You know, there's a lot
of wildlife up here, you know?

01:02:53.017 --> 01:02:54.019
It's right there.

01:02:59.957 --> 01:03:02.193
O Lord, Jesus Christ,
please forgive his sins,

01:03:02.227 --> 01:03:04.363
just as You forgave those
who crucified You.

01:03:04.396 --> 01:03:05.464
Stop. Get up.

01:03:05.497 --> 01:03:06.866
Count not the transgressions,

01:03:06.899 --> 01:03:08.000
but rather his tears of
repentance.

01:03:08.033 --> 01:03:09.468
I said get up!

01:03:09.501 --> 01:03:11.102
For he knows not
what he's gonna do, please.

01:03:11.135 --> 01:03:12.604
Look!

01:03:12.638 --> 01:03:16.909
Look, man, you do this for me,
I promise you,

01:03:16.941 --> 01:03:19.410
I'll pop off a shot
and let him think you're dead.

01:03:19.443 --> 01:03:22.347
It'll all be over.
You understand?

01:03:22.381 --> 01:03:24.149
Yeah, but since the calls
came from this property,

01:03:24.182 --> 01:03:26.651
that gives me probable cause
to look inside.

01:03:26.685 --> 01:03:31.290
With all due respect, sheriff,
that doesn't sound right.

01:03:33.057 --> 01:03:35.193
Right?

01:03:35.227 --> 01:03:38.397
You mean using, selling drugs,
that kinda right?

01:03:38.430 --> 01:03:40.165
I don't wanna go back to prison.

01:03:42.401 --> 01:03:44.103
I'm not a bad man.

01:03:44.135 --> 01:03:46.604
I never have been.

01:03:46.638 --> 01:03:48.641
But I need this lick, man.

01:03:48.673 --> 01:03:50.642
All right?

01:03:50.676 --> 01:03:54.179
The code's 4-9-2-9.

01:03:54.211 --> 01:03:58.117
I'm not going in there. Whatever happens
in that cave is between you and God.

01:04:05.356 --> 01:04:08.059
Hey, you know,
marijuana's legal now.

01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:11.430
We're paying your salary.

01:04:11.463 --> 01:04:12.598
Sheriff Garber!

01:04:23.642 --> 01:04:26.111
[lock clicking]

01:04:33.084 --> 01:04:34.086
Have a seat.

01:04:36.053 --> 01:04:37.488
Do it!

01:04:37.522 --> 01:04:39.558
We had a bachelor party
last night.

01:04:39.591 --> 01:04:41.327
You know something,

01:04:41.359 --> 01:04:44.129
getting kinda sick of listening
to your bullshit.

01:04:46.231 --> 01:04:47.433
Shit.

01:04:47.466 --> 01:04:48.701
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:04:55.774 --> 01:04:57.576
Bag. You got a bag?

01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:17.629
What's in there?

01:05:18.497 --> 01:05:19.665
It's just a closet.

01:05:21.265 --> 01:05:22.367
[Rob]
<i>Almost done.</i>

01:05:25.470 --> 01:05:27.272
Keep 'em comin'.

01:05:27.305 --> 01:05:28.607
Yeah.

01:05:41.653 --> 01:05:44.357
Hey, do me a favor,
pick up the rest of those.

01:05:46.691 --> 01:05:48.426
Hurry up.
[groans]

01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:56.702
[panting]

01:06:12.350 --> 01:06:14.153
[banging]

01:06:15.787 --> 01:06:18.491
All right!
Don't move!

01:06:36.841 --> 01:06:38.410
[winces]

01:06:59.763 --> 01:07:01.232
Whoa...

01:07:01.265 --> 01:07:03.367
I'm sorry to scare you,
señorita.

01:07:03.401 --> 01:07:04.403
What the fuck?

01:07:09.508 --> 01:07:11.343
I told you,
we were having a party.

01:07:20.919 --> 01:07:23.355
[panting]

01:07:25.490 --> 01:07:28.160
Get down on the ground,
right now!

01:07:28.193 --> 01:07:29.727
[gun clicks]

01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:31.329
[groans]

01:07:32.664 --> 01:07:34.432
Shit!

01:07:34.466 --> 01:07:35.434
[sheriff]
I will blow your head off!

01:07:35.466 --> 01:07:36.568
Do it, now!

01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:38.470
Sheriff!

01:07:38.502 --> 01:07:40.271
[yelling]

01:07:44.508 --> 01:07:46.778
Fuckin' stupid...
[mutters]

01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:51.583
Sorry to scare you, señorita.

01:08:22.846 --> 01:08:24.815
My condolences.

01:08:24.848 --> 01:08:26.718
Condolences for what?

01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:31.556
You think that shot
was for my man?

01:08:32.856 --> 01:08:35.761
Rob's from a family of Marines.

01:08:35.793 --> 01:08:39.864
Where did your big black sex toy
learn how to handle a gun?

01:08:39.897 --> 01:08:42.868
<i>He's a thief, not a killer.</i>

01:08:42.900 --> 01:08:45.269
You know fuck all about it.

01:08:45.302 --> 01:08:47.238
That's why you're just
a wee farm whore.

01:08:47.271 --> 01:08:49.341
My man's not dead.

01:08:51.842 --> 01:08:53.878
[speaking Spanish]

01:08:53.912 --> 01:08:55.713
Swift!

01:08:55.747 --> 01:08:57.216
[speaking Spanish]

01:08:57.248 --> 01:08:58.583
Say he's dead again.

01:08:59.818 --> 01:09:01.852
I don't think he's dead,
but he's gone.

01:09:01.886 --> 01:09:03.455
Surprise.

01:09:03.488 --> 01:09:04.789
Gone how?

01:09:04.823 --> 01:09:06.490
He's been scheming on you

01:09:06.524 --> 01:09:07.726
ever since you went
to get the truck.

01:09:07.758 --> 01:09:09.761
Asked if I could
just punt the weed.

01:09:09.793 --> 01:09:12.564
[scoffs] I wouldn't trust you
to walk my dog.

01:09:12.596 --> 01:09:17.301
It's true, even if it's coming
from this piece of shit.

01:09:17.334 --> 01:09:20.605
I could tell he wanted to leave
ever since you killed that kid.

01:09:20.638 --> 01:09:24.909
[whispering] He wouldn't get very far.
I have the keys.

01:09:24.943 --> 01:09:26.945
He could have wired
the truck though.

01:09:26.977 --> 01:09:28.814
Took the other guy's car.

01:09:34.619 --> 01:09:36.755
Take the cuffs.

01:09:36.788 --> 01:09:40.359
And, Adder... leave the pistol.

01:10:02.713 --> 01:10:04.783
Aye.
Come here, you.

01:10:04.815 --> 01:10:07.019
[grunting]

01:10:20.731 --> 01:10:22.267
And why'd you stick around?

01:10:24.703 --> 01:10:29.008
I told you...
I'm going to pay off my debt.

01:10:29.774 --> 01:10:31.310
And why?

01:10:34.378 --> 01:10:35.948
I didn't want to run from you.

01:10:38.850 --> 01:10:39.918
Smart.

01:10:45.556 --> 01:10:46.891
[laughing]

01:10:52.364 --> 01:10:53.499
Sorry.

01:10:54.598 --> 01:10:55.601
Keys.

01:10:56.633 --> 01:10:57.903
Give me the keys.

01:10:57.936 --> 01:10:59.604
Give me the fucking keys!

01:10:59.637 --> 01:11:01.040
Give me the keys.

01:11:10.547 --> 01:11:11.684
Swift!

01:11:12.617 --> 01:11:15.486
Swift!

01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:17.423
Ah, I hope you
enjoyed the fucking show!

01:11:22.961 --> 01:11:24.062
Fuck you!

01:11:25.462 --> 01:11:27.998
Baby, baby, I'm sorry.

01:11:28.031 --> 01:11:30.435
How could you bring
someone like that here, huh?

01:11:30.467 --> 01:11:32.104
[Ticker]
You out here?!

01:11:33.471 --> 01:11:35.440
I know you out here!

01:11:35.472 --> 01:11:36.941
Right boy?!

01:11:36.975 --> 01:11:38.877
Do you have a hair pin?

01:11:38.909 --> 01:11:41.412
- Maria!
- In the... dresser.

01:11:43.815 --> 01:11:46.819
Or are you just another runner?!

01:11:48.052 --> 01:11:49.721
[Adder] <i>I didn't have a choice.</i>

01:11:49.753 --> 01:11:51.155
Of course you had a choice!
You chose!

01:11:51.189 --> 01:11:53.658
They weren't taking "no"
for an answer.

01:11:53.690 --> 01:11:55.927
- Hurry the fuck up!
- I'm trying!

01:11:58.695 --> 01:12:02.133
I admit, things got a little
dicey back there, fucked.

01:12:02.167 --> 01:12:04.803
But if we hustle outta here now,

01:12:04.836 --> 01:12:07.606
we still got a chance
for our happy ending.

01:12:07.638 --> 01:12:09.908
[speaking Spanish]

01:12:11.476 --> 01:12:13.779
I don't speak fucking Spanish!

01:12:13.811 --> 01:12:17.082
Did you even hesitate
to put my life in danger?

01:12:17.114 --> 01:12:21.119
- Baby, baby...
- Stop fucking calling me "baby."

01:12:32.196 --> 01:12:33.464
Shit!

01:12:38.669 --> 01:12:42.740
My cousin is dead...
because of you!

01:12:48.178 --> 01:12:50.181
Wait, wait, is this about...

01:12:52.717 --> 01:12:54.887
Are you knocked up for real?

01:12:57.020 --> 01:12:58.756
Fuck you.

01:13:16.908 --> 01:13:19.111
You were supposed to
wear protection.

01:13:20.778 --> 01:13:21.847
You know what...?

01:13:34.292 --> 01:13:36.127
Let's just go.
We'll get it taken care of, OK?

01:13:36.159 --> 01:13:38.129
Just go!
Fucking, come on!

01:14:16.333 --> 01:14:20.304
Tell me you feel good...
killing him like that!

01:14:20.337 --> 01:14:22.573
Make you feel like a real man?!

01:14:25.810 --> 01:14:26.979
[groans]

01:14:28.312 --> 01:14:29.515

01:15:14.792 --> 01:15:15.994
[yells]

01:15:16.793 --> 01:15:18.195
You better run.

01:15:22.833 --> 01:15:25.936
You better fucking run!

01:15:25.970 --> 01:15:27.972
[Maria] So, what,
we'll just load up the weed,

01:15:28.006 --> 01:15:29.841
and then go drive
a thousand miles to sell it?!

01:15:29.873 --> 01:15:31.876
- That's your plan?
- Have you got a better one?

01:15:31.909 --> 01:15:33.778
That's what
we were gonna do anyway!

01:15:33.811 --> 01:15:36.181
You had one job to do! One!

01:15:36.213 --> 01:15:39.149
Not fuck the shit up for both of us!
And you fucked it up!

01:15:39.182 --> 01:15:42.886
I wasn't fucking expecting
some clock-faced psychopath

01:15:42.919 --> 01:15:44.689
to come through the door
and demand things!

01:15:44.721 --> 01:15:46.390
If it wasn't for your dumbass,

01:15:46.423 --> 01:15:48.260
he would've
never fucking came here!

01:15:53.931 --> 01:15:55.801
- [wind whipping]
- [groans]

01:15:59.337 --> 01:16:02.173
My fucking fault?! I decide when
he gets fucking paroled, do I?!

01:16:02.205 --> 01:16:03.374
I fucking decide?!

01:16:03.408 --> 01:16:05.944
[speaking Spanish]

01:16:05.976 --> 01:16:09.046
- [Adder] I don't speak fucking Spanish!
- I don't give a fuck!

01:16:19.089 --> 01:16:20.859
You nearly got us,
all of us, killed!

01:16:20.891 --> 01:16:23.327
Do you know how much fucking
easier it would've been

01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:25.329
not to come back in there
and fucking leave?!

01:16:25.363 --> 01:16:28.900
You want me to thank you?!
Thank you! Thank you for that!

01:16:28.932 --> 01:16:31.202
A thank you woulda been
fucking nice!

01:16:31.235 --> 01:16:33.338
<i>I'm the fucking one
that came down the hall...</i>

01:16:33.370 --> 01:16:34.772
- And then what?!
- ...and saved your fucking ass!

01:16:34.806 --> 01:16:36.408
Oh, saved me!

01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:38.376
Well, you know what,
I wish you fucking hadn't!

01:16:38.409 --> 01:16:39.778
[grunts]

01:16:42.212 --> 01:16:43.747
Look, look, look, while your...

01:16:43.780 --> 01:16:46.818
...while your fucking baby-daddy
and Cogsworth

01:16:46.851 --> 01:16:48.053
are out there
fighting in the dirt,

01:16:48.086 --> 01:16:49.988
we'll be well on our way
to Motown.

01:16:50.020 --> 01:16:52.089
You are fucking retarded!

01:16:52.123 --> 01:16:55.727
Do you know how much this fucking
shit sells for in Detroit?!

01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:57.995
[grunting]

01:17:07.038 --> 01:17:09.808
And then what?
Huh?

01:17:09.841 --> 01:17:11.209
What do you fucking mean?

01:17:11.242 --> 01:17:13.712
What will we do?
What will become of us?

01:17:14.345 --> 01:17:16.048
Become of us?

01:17:18.382 --> 01:17:21.052
[wheezes]

01:17:21.084 --> 01:17:23.922
If you'd just
done that in the first place,

01:17:23.954 --> 01:17:26.223
everybody'd still be alive!

01:17:32.395 --> 01:17:33.798
[wheezes]

01:17:34.798 --> 01:17:36.100
Are you fucking serious?

01:17:36.133 --> 01:17:37.468
[yelling]

01:17:37.502 --> 01:17:39.838
- [groans]
- [grunts]

01:17:42.839 --> 01:17:44.309
Fuck it.

01:17:45.142 --> 01:17:46.910
Still ticking.

01:17:46.944 --> 01:17:48.480
Still tick, tick...

01:17:50.314 --> 01:17:52.784
You got that out of your system?

01:17:52.816 --> 01:17:54.953
Just shoot me in the head, pal.

01:17:54.985 --> 01:17:58.289
No, I want you
to take your time dying.

01:18:00.223 --> 01:18:02.427
What? What the fuck?!

01:18:02.459 --> 01:18:05.930
We'll get your fucking situation
squared away, work on our next move.

01:18:05.962 --> 01:18:07.297
Let this all blow over.

01:18:07.330 --> 01:18:08.432
We've done it
a fucking millions times before,

01:18:08.466 --> 01:18:10.001
we'll do it again!

01:18:19.342 --> 01:18:20.345
No.

01:18:25.182 --> 01:18:27.952
I'll leave it to the animals
to finish you off.

01:18:27.985 --> 01:18:29.154
Yeah, and then what?

01:18:30.421 --> 01:18:33.223
We're all fucking animals, son.

01:18:33.257 --> 01:18:35.127
[laughing]

01:18:49.039 --> 01:18:50.507
We got Rob!

01:18:50.540 --> 01:18:52.310
It's... so glad you're okay.

01:18:52.342 --> 01:18:54.278
I just got here
and found Maria all tied up.

01:18:58.415 --> 01:18:59.950
Where's your car?

01:18:59.984 --> 01:19:01.519
It's the gate, they locked it,
I had to...

01:19:01.552 --> 01:19:02.788
I had to leg it in.

01:19:04.055 --> 01:19:05.923
He threatened our baby.

01:19:05.957 --> 01:19:07.559
He did this!
He brought them here!

01:19:07.592 --> 01:19:09.160
He got your brother killed!

01:19:09.193 --> 01:19:10.962
Maria, what the fuck!
You know that's not true!

01:19:10.994 --> 01:19:12.196
Let's not start blaming each...

01:19:25.443 --> 01:19:28.245
[grunting]

01:19:32.182 --> 01:19:33.885
[radio chatter indistinct]

01:19:33.918 --> 01:19:34.920
[Maria]
Where is it?

01:19:49.667 --> 01:19:51.336
Where the fuck is it?

01:20:02.279 --> 01:20:04.448
You fuck!
You fuck!

01:20:10.988 --> 01:20:12.624
You like fucking my girl?!

01:20:12.656 --> 01:20:15.961
She's a good fucking actress,
isn't she?

01:20:19.230 --> 01:20:20.598
You think that she fucking likes
you?!

01:20:24.368 --> 01:20:26.537
- [gunshot]
- [groans]

01:20:26.570 --> 01:20:30.408
[coughing]

01:20:46.623 --> 01:20:53.463
I swear, I prayed for protection,
from everything, from this.

01:20:53.497 --> 01:20:56.401
- What, leaving me for dead?
- No, that's not true!

01:20:56.434 --> 01:20:59.070
I didn't know!
He was making me leave.

01:20:59.102 --> 01:21:01.405
Then why you still
pointing a gun at me, Maria?

01:21:01.439 --> 01:21:04.542
Why are you asking me that,
instead of asking if we're okay?

01:21:04.574 --> 01:21:08.245
We?
Is it even really mine?

01:21:10.181 --> 01:21:14.586
I don't know...
but... but I want her to be.

01:21:16.486 --> 01:21:20.357
I chose you. I choose you.

01:21:22.025 --> 01:21:26.430
But if that's not enough,
I can raise her on my own.

01:21:26.463 --> 01:21:28.198
[laughing]

01:21:28.231 --> 01:21:30.501
I got nothing left to give,
Maria!

01:21:30.534 --> 01:21:32.136
Why don't you go get
your money bag

01:21:32.168 --> 01:21:34.071
from your other friend
in the cave?

01:21:34.105 --> 01:21:36.741
Please, don't make me do this.

01:21:36.774 --> 01:21:39.077
[laughing]

01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:40.712
What... what else do you
want me to give?

01:21:40.744 --> 01:21:42.579
What do you want from me?!

01:21:42.613 --> 01:21:45.149
What do you want me to do?!
What do you expect?!

01:21:45.181 --> 01:21:48.185
How do you expect me
to make this work, huh?

01:21:48.218 --> 01:21:50.488
After this?

01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:52.622
Because you believe
in serendipity.

01:21:52.655 --> 01:21:54.359
[panting]

01:22:08.439 --> 01:22:11.242
Hey, no! No! No!

[narrator] <i>The mythology for
these enemies is well-known.</i>

01:22:48.546 --> 01:22:52.617
<i>And although hyenas
have a reputation as thieves,</i>

01:22:52.650 --> 01:22:55.520
<i>they are more than
capable predators.</i>

01:22:55.552 --> 01:22:58.256
<i>The matriarch
both dominates her pack,</i>

01:22:58.288 --> 01:23:03.727
<i>and fiercely defends it from
the lions who stalk her cubs;</i>

01:23:03.761 --> 01:23:07.632
<i>for the lion and hyena
are sympatric.</i>

must embrace her independence</i>

01:23:35.592 --> 01:23:38.428
