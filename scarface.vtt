WEBVTT

03:36.739 --> 03:38.407
What do you call yourself,
huh?

03:40.117 --> 03:42.703
Antonio Montana.

03:42.786 --> 03:44.872
And you,
what you call yourself?

03:45.164 --> 03:47.082
Where'd you learn English,
Tony?

03:47.166 --> 03:48.292
In school.

03:49.001 --> 03:51.670
And my father, he was
from the United States.

03:52.504 --> 03:54.214
Just like you, you know?

03:54.965 --> 03:56.508
He was a Yankee.

03:57.134 --> 03:59.094
He used to take me
a lot to the movies.

03:59.178 --> 04:00.262
I learned.

04:00.346 --> 04:04.183
I watch the guys like Humphrey
Bogart, James Cagney.

04:05.643 --> 04:09.563
They teach me to talk.
I like those guys.

04:09.647 --> 04:13.192
I always know one day I'm coming
here, United States.

04:13.317 --> 04:14.818
So where's your old man now?

04:14.902 --> 04:17.029
He dead. He die.

04:17.279 --> 04:19.323
Sometime. Somewhere.

04:19.406 --> 04:20.491
Mother?

04:20.574 --> 04:21.617
She dead, too.

04:21.825 --> 04:23.327
What kind of work
you do in Cuba?

04:23.410 --> 04:24.870
You know, things.

04:24.954 --> 04:27.998
I was this, that.

04:28.916 --> 04:30.459
Construction business.

04:31.210 --> 04:34.213
I work a lot with my hands.
I was in the Army.

04:34.546 --> 04:36.090
Any family in the States?

04:36.173 --> 04:37.466
Cousins,
brother-in-law, anybody?

04:37.549 --> 04:40.678
Nobody.
Everybody's dead.

04:41.011 --> 04:42.805
You ever been to jail,
Tony?

04:42.888 --> 04:46.600
Me? Jail? No way, no.

04:46.934 --> 04:49.103
Been in a mental hospital?

04:49.186 --> 04:51.313
Oh, yeah.
On the boat coming over.

04:52.731 --> 04:55.776
What about homosexuality, Tony?
You like men, huh?

04:55.943 --> 04:58.487
You like to dress
up like a woman?

04:59.071 --> 05:01.657
What is wrong with this guy?
He kidding me or what?

05:01.740 --> 05:03.993
Just answer the questions,
Tony.

05:04.284 --> 05:06.286
Okay. No.

05:07.413 --> 05:08.539
Fuck, no.

05:09.123 --> 05:12.418
Arrested for vagrancy?
Marijuana?

05:12.584 --> 05:14.128
- Never, man.
- Heroin?

05:14.211 --> 05:15.421
Cocaine?

05:15.504 --> 05:16.672
No.

05:18.424 --> 05:21.760
Where'd you get the beauty
scar, tough guy? Eating pussy?

05:23.220 --> 05:26.515
How am I gonna get a scar
like that eating pussy?

05:27.307 --> 05:29.685
This was when I
was a kid, you know?

05:29.768 --> 05:30.769
Mmm-hmm.

05:30.853 --> 05:33.981
You should see the other kid.
You can't recognize him.

05:34.064 --> 05:35.274
And this?

05:36.066 --> 05:38.569
What? That's nothing.
That's from my sweetheart.

05:38.652 --> 05:40.362
Sweetheart, my ass!

05:40.446 --> 05:42.156
We've been seeing more
and more of these.

05:42.406 --> 05:44.908
Some kind of code these
guys used in the can.

05:44.992 --> 05:47.494
Pitchfork means
an assassin or something.

05:47.578 --> 05:49.079
You want to
tell us about it,

05:49.163 --> 05:52.124
or you want to take a trip
to the detention center?

05:53.876 --> 05:56.170
Okay, you got me.

05:56.336 --> 05:58.255
I was in the can one time.

05:58.338 --> 06:00.174
For buying dollars.
Big deal.

06:00.299 --> 06:01.383
That's pretty
funny, Tony.

06:01.467 --> 06:02.551
That's true.

06:02.634 --> 06:04.470
It was a Canadian tourist.

06:04.553 --> 06:06.805
Did you mug him first?
Get him out of here!

06:06.889 --> 06:08.015
Come on!

06:08.098 --> 06:09.183
So I fuck up!

06:09.433 --> 06:10.684
Let me talk
to this guy.

06:10.768 --> 06:12.603
Please! Let me talk
to him a minute.

06:12.686 --> 06:14.021
You a Communist?

06:15.064 --> 06:16.148
Huh?

06:16.815 --> 06:18.317
How'd you like it?

06:18.400 --> 06:19.943
They tell you
always what to do,

06:20.027 --> 06:22.279
what to think,
what to feel.

06:22.362 --> 06:23.822
Do you want to
be like a sheep?

06:23.906 --> 06:25.074
Like all those
other people?

06:26.366 --> 06:28.035
I don't have to
listen to this!

06:28.118 --> 06:29.912
You wanna work 8,
10 fucking hours?

06:29.995 --> 06:32.164
You own nothing,
you got nothing!

06:33.624 --> 06:35.626
Do you want a <i>chivato</i>
on every corner,

06:35.709 --> 06:37.211
watching everything
you do?

06:37.294 --> 06:38.962
Everything you say, man?

06:39.671 --> 06:41.799
You know I eat octopus
three times a day?

06:41.882 --> 06:44.259
I got fucking octopus
coming out of my ears.

06:44.343 --> 06:47.679
I got fucking Russian shoes,
my feet's coming through.

06:48.222 --> 06:49.765
How'd you like that?

06:50.349 --> 06:52.976
You want me to stay there
and do nothing?

06:53.060 --> 06:56.438
I'm no fucking criminal, man.
I'm no <i>puta</i> or thief.

06:56.647 --> 07:00.275
I'm Tony Montana,
a political prisoner from Cuba.

07:00.818 --> 07:03.570
I want my fucking
human rights, now!

07:03.654 --> 07:06.698
Like President
Jimmy Carter says. Okay?

07:07.908 --> 07:10.911
Carter should see this human right.
He's really good.

07:10.994 --> 07:11.995
What do you say?

07:12.079 --> 07:13.789
I don't believe
any of this shit!

07:13.872 --> 07:15.624
They all sound
alike to me.

07:15.707 --> 07:18.085
That Castro is
shitting all over us.

07:18.168 --> 07:21.088
Send the bastard to Freedom Town.
Let them see him.

07:21.171 --> 07:22.172
Get him out of here.

07:22.256 --> 07:23.257
You know something?

07:23.340 --> 07:24.424
You can send me
anywhere.

07:24.508 --> 07:26.802
Here, there, this, that.
It don't matter.

07:26.885 --> 07:28.554
There's nothing
you can do to me

07:28.637 --> 07:29.888
that Castro
hasn't done...

07:29.972 --> 07:31.306
Get him out of here!

07:33.809 --> 07:35.894
- So?
- So?

07:36.395 --> 07:38.313
What'd you tell them?

07:38.397 --> 07:40.357
What you told
me to tell them.

07:40.440 --> 07:43.152
That we...
I was in sanitation.

07:44.361 --> 07:46.071
They didn't go for it.

07:46.155 --> 07:47.322
Sanitation?

07:47.406 --> 07:48.490
Yeah.

07:48.740 --> 07:50.325
I told you to
tell them

07:50.409 --> 07:54.163
you was in a sanitarium,
not sanitation.

07:55.205 --> 07:56.582
Sanitarium. Yeah.

07:56.665 --> 07:58.041
You didn't tell me that.

07:58.125 --> 08:03.046
No, I told you to say you had
TB and you was in a sanitarium.

08:03.213 --> 08:04.548
You was cured.

08:05.340 --> 08:07.968
When did you
tell me that?

08:08.051 --> 08:09.136
You should've
kept your mouth shut.

08:09.219 --> 08:11.513
They'd think you was a
horse and let you out.

09:12.449 --> 09:14.409
Tony! Montana!

09:15.035 --> 09:17.537
Tony Montana!
Come here.

09:18.580 --> 09:20.874
Come here, man.
I gotta talk to you.

09:21.083 --> 09:23.043
Come on, man.
It's important.

09:24.169 --> 09:26.088
So close, man.
Come on.

09:26.880 --> 09:28.382
I gotta talk to you.

09:28.465 --> 09:29.549
Where are you going?

09:29.633 --> 09:30.676
Leave him alone.

09:30.759 --> 09:31.885
I got better
things to do.

09:31.969 --> 09:34.179
You're chicken, man.
You almost made it.

09:34.263 --> 09:36.890
Are you ready
for some good news?

09:37.391 --> 09:39.101
Sure.
What you got, man?

09:39.184 --> 09:41.270
We can be outta
this place in 30 days.

09:41.353 --> 09:44.898
Not only that, but we got a
green card and a job in Miami.

09:45.023 --> 09:47.276
Now are we made or
are we made, man?

09:47.401 --> 09:50.821
What do we gotta do?
Go to Cuba and hit the Beard?

09:50.904 --> 09:52.447
No, man,
somebody else.

09:52.531 --> 09:53.573
You're kidding.

09:53.657 --> 09:54.908
No.

09:54.992 --> 09:56.201
You're not kidding?

09:57.536 --> 10:00.455
Guy named Rebenga, man.
Emilio Rebenga.

10:00.539 --> 10:01.707
Rebenga?

10:02.708 --> 10:03.917
I know that name.

10:04.001 --> 10:05.210
Yeah?

10:05.294 --> 10:06.878
He's political.
Yeah.

10:07.254 --> 10:10.757
Well, he's coming in here today.
Castro just sprung him.

10:11.091 --> 10:14.720
This guy was one of the top dogs
for Fidel in the early days.

10:15.137 --> 10:19.391
Castro felt he couldn't trust
him and threw him in jail.

10:19.808 --> 10:22.811
But while he was on top,
he tortured a few guys to death.

10:22.894 --> 10:26.231
One of the guy's brothers
is a rich guy in Miami now.

10:26.315 --> 10:27.774
He wants
the favor repaid.

10:27.983 --> 10:29.651
That's where
we come in.

10:31.528 --> 10:33.572
It's ugly, man.

10:33.739 --> 10:35.657
Yeah.

10:41.663 --> 10:45.375
You tell your guys
in Miami, your friend,

10:46.001 --> 10:47.711
it'd be a pleasure.

10:48.086 --> 10:50.255
I'd kill a Communist
for fun,

10:51.006 --> 10:54.843
but for a green card,
I gonna carve him up real nice.

12:14.381 --> 12:15.715
Rebenga!

12:55.547 --> 12:57.382
From a friend
you fucked!

13:29.080 --> 13:30.957
That face.
That's nice.

13:34.085 --> 13:35.378
That doesn't
look like me.

13:35.462 --> 13:37.214
That looks pretty, man.

13:38.882 --> 13:39.925
Whoo!

14:10.914 --> 14:11.957
Fuck!

14:12.123 --> 14:13.291
What's wrong, man?

14:16.294 --> 14:19.089
Your big shot friend better
come up with something soon.

14:19.172 --> 14:21.758
I didn't come to the U.S.
to break my fucking back.

14:21.841 --> 14:24.302
He's coming!
What do you want from me?

14:25.178 --> 14:26.471
Fucking thing!

14:26.805 --> 14:27.847
I told you.

14:30.475 --> 14:31.768
What's wrong?

14:46.157 --> 14:47.284
Look at that one.

14:47.367 --> 14:49.911
That one in the pink.
She's beautiful.

14:49.995 --> 14:51.788
Look at those titties.

14:52.497 --> 14:54.291
Look at that punk with her.

14:54.666 --> 14:56.876
What's he got
that I don't have?

14:57.836 --> 15:01.172
Well, he's very handsome,
for one thing, you know?

15:04.676 --> 15:06.803
I mean, look at
the way he dresses.

15:06.886 --> 15:10.432
Come on. That's style,
flash, pizzazz.

15:10.515 --> 15:13.560
And a little coke money
doesn't hurt nobody.

15:17.856 --> 15:19.065
Look at this.

15:20.191 --> 15:21.526
Fucking onions.

15:24.237 --> 15:27.198
They ought to be picking
gold from the street.

15:28.241 --> 15:30.160
Oh, God,
I can feel it.

15:31.244 --> 15:34.039
There's two guys looking
for you out there.

15:36.041 --> 15:38.293
That's him, man.
That's <i>El mono.</i>
I told you.

15:38.376 --> 15:40.086
Don't stay too fucking long.

15:40.211 --> 15:42.589
We've got a lot
of work to do.

16:02.359 --> 16:04.235
Waldo!
Good to see you, man.

16:04.361 --> 16:07.822
This is my friend Tony Montana
I've been telling you about.

16:07.906 --> 16:11.284
Tony, that's Omar Suarez,
and that's Waldo Rojas over there.

16:11.701 --> 16:13.161
I got something
for you.

16:13.244 --> 16:15.288
Yeah?
What do we gotta do?

16:15.413 --> 16:16.498
Gotta unload a boat.

16:16.581 --> 16:18.917
Marijuana. 45 tons.
You get 500 each.

16:19.042 --> 16:22.170
500? That's great.

16:22.253 --> 16:23.546
You gotta be kidding.

16:26.758 --> 16:28.093
500?

16:29.427 --> 16:31.930
Who do you think we are,
baggage handlers?

16:34.265 --> 16:37.018
The going rate on a boat
is 1,000 a night.

16:37.102 --> 16:38.144
You know that.

16:38.478 --> 16:41.064
First you gotta work
your way up to 500.

16:41.147 --> 16:43.692
What I did for you in Freedom
Town, what was that?

16:43.775 --> 16:45.944
That Rebenga hit
was a game of dominoes?

16:46.069 --> 16:47.028
That was something else.

16:47.112 --> 16:48.613
Shut up!
Take it easy.

16:48.738 --> 16:51.282
What's with this
dishwasher, <i>chico?</i>

16:51.449 --> 16:53.034
Don't he know
we could've got

16:53.118 --> 16:54.994
any space cadet to
hit Rebenga cheaper?

16:55.120 --> 16:56.246
50 bucks!

16:56.329 --> 16:57.455
Then why didn't you?

16:57.622 --> 16:59.541
Don't call me no
fucking dishwasher,

16:59.624 --> 17:00.959
or I'll kick
your monkey ass.

17:01.084 --> 17:02.752
Who the fuck are you?

17:03.795 --> 17:05.463
You can't do that, man!

17:05.588 --> 17:07.841
The Colombians!

17:12.137 --> 17:14.139
Okay, all right,
big man!

17:14.264 --> 17:15.974
You want to make
some big bucks?

17:16.057 --> 17:17.809
Let's see
how tough you are.

17:18.101 --> 17:20.311
You know something
about cocaine?

17:24.774 --> 17:26.443
You kidding me or what?

17:27.819 --> 17:30.321
There's a bunch of
Colombians coming in Friday.

17:30.447 --> 17:31.781
New guys.

17:31.865 --> 17:34.409
They say they got two keys
for us, for openers.

17:34.492 --> 17:36.911
Pure coke.
Hotel in Miami Beach.

17:36.995 --> 17:38.538
I want you to
go over there.

17:38.663 --> 17:41.040
If it's what they say,
pay them and bring it back.

17:41.166 --> 17:43.209
Do that,
you got 5 grand.

17:46.171 --> 17:48.339
Go, pay them,
bring it back, yeah?

17:51.718 --> 17:53.887
You know how to handle
a machine gun?

17:54.012 --> 17:56.139
Yeah, man.
We were in the Army.

17:56.222 --> 17:58.308
You gonna need
a couple other guys.

17:58.391 --> 17:59.851
That's no problem.

18:00.852 --> 18:02.979
Be at Hector's bodega
at noon, Friday.

18:03.062 --> 18:04.981
You get the
buy money then.

18:06.816 --> 18:11.279
If anything happens
to that buy money,

18:11.362 --> 18:14.073
my boss will stick your
heads up your asses

18:14.199 --> 18:16.367
faster than
a rabbit gets fucked!

18:16.493 --> 18:17.911
I'm scared.

18:20.747 --> 18:22.749
You're pushing your luck.
Don't worry.

18:22.874 --> 18:23.958
That was dumb.

18:24.042 --> 18:25.960
You worry too much.

18:26.044 --> 18:27.504
You'll have
a heart attack.

18:27.587 --> 18:30.757
You act like that guy's doing
you a favor or something.

18:30.882 --> 18:33.092
What's this with
the Colombians?

18:33.176 --> 18:34.803
What does it matter?

18:35.053 --> 18:39.015
He says "Colombians,"
and you make these eyes...

18:39.098 --> 18:42.227
I don't like
fucking Colombians, okay?

18:43.478 --> 18:44.896
What you guys doing?

18:44.979 --> 18:47.065
There's a lot of dishes
to be washed.

18:47.232 --> 18:48.900
Wash them yourself.

18:50.151 --> 18:51.236
I retire!

18:51.569 --> 18:53.780
What the fuck
you gonna do now?

18:53.988 --> 18:54.989
Don't come back here!

18:55.073 --> 18:57.283
I gotta look after
my investment!

18:57.408 --> 18:59.327
Fuck you guys!

18:59.410 --> 19:00.745
Close the shop!

19:16.469 --> 19:19.138
Look at those tits.
She's begging for it.

19:19.264 --> 19:21.224
Are you fucking crazy?

19:21.307 --> 19:22.642
She's 103 years old.

19:23.434 --> 19:25.395
Not that one, man!
That one!

19:25.478 --> 19:26.479
Which one?

19:26.563 --> 19:27.522
The young one.

19:27.605 --> 19:30.400
Move the fucking car.
We're at a stop sign.

19:33.152 --> 19:36.656
We're just staying loose up here.
You gotta stay loose.

19:36.781 --> 19:39.284
You can't worry.
You'll have a heart attack.

19:39.367 --> 19:41.744
Just play it cool.
Miami Beach.

19:41.828 --> 19:43.830
Miami Beach, man!

20:05.560 --> 20:07.812
The money stays in the
trunk till I come out.

20:07.896 --> 20:10.523
You got it?
Me, nobody else. Okay.

20:10.899 --> 20:14.652
I'm not out in 15 minutes,
something's wrong. Okay?

20:14.819 --> 20:16.529
Room 9. You ready?

20:16.613 --> 20:18.156
Sure thing.

21:18.216 --> 21:20.593
Okay. You mind
leaving the door open?

21:20.718 --> 21:22.845
So my brother-in-law sees
everything's okay.

21:22.929 --> 21:24.931
Sure. No problem.

21:26.224 --> 21:27.558
No problem.

21:28.893 --> 21:31.771
Hello. This is Marta.

21:36.067 --> 21:37.568
Marta, hello.

21:40.071 --> 21:41.823
I am Hector.

21:42.490 --> 21:43.908
And I am Tony.

21:48.246 --> 21:50.707
So, Omar says
you're okay.

21:50.790 --> 21:54.585
Yeah? Good.
Omar's okay.

21:55.670 --> 21:56.838
Okay.

22:02.468 --> 22:04.929
So, you got
the money?

22:08.474 --> 22:09.809
You got the stuff?

22:09.934 --> 22:13.604
Sure I have the stuff,
but not right here with me now.

22:13.688 --> 22:15.356
I got it close by.

22:19.485 --> 22:21.988
I don't have
the money either, man.

22:23.948 --> 22:25.783
I have it close by, too.

22:27.827 --> 22:28.953
Where?

22:30.788 --> 22:31.956
In the car?

22:33.124 --> 22:34.792
No, not in the car, man.

22:34.876 --> 22:36.044
No?

22:36.794 --> 22:39.714
How about you?
Where you have your stuff?

22:42.467 --> 22:43.468
Not far.

22:51.309 --> 22:54.687
Okay.
You want me to come in?
We start over again?

22:56.564 --> 22:58.024
Where you from, Tony?

22:58.149 --> 23:01.444
What the fuck difference
does it make where I'm from?

23:02.862 --> 23:04.322
Take it easy, man.

23:06.157 --> 23:08.659
I just want to get to know
who I do business with.

23:08.743 --> 23:13.331
You'll know me once you do business
with me and stop fucking around.

23:13.873 --> 23:14.999
Okay?

23:15.416 --> 23:17.168
What's the story?
Tony!

23:26.761 --> 23:30.890
You know, Frog Face,
you just fucked yourself.

23:31.599 --> 23:32.809
You steal from me,
you're dead.

23:32.892 --> 23:34.102
Yeah?

23:39.023 --> 23:41.025
You want to
give me the cash,

23:42.235 --> 23:44.570
or do I kill
your brother first

23:45.404 --> 23:47.031
before I kill you?

23:48.908 --> 23:52.453
Why don't you try sticking
your head up your ass?

23:52.912 --> 23:54.789
See if it fits.

23:56.541 --> 23:58.918
Yeah? Okay.

24:22.400 --> 24:23.985
<i>Yeah, it's very important.</i>

24:24.068 --> 24:25.528
<i>I understand it's important.</i>

24:25.611 --> 24:27.238
<i>- Thank you.
- You're welcome.</i>

24:27.738 --> 24:29.073
<i>You forecasted
an earthquake</i>

24:29.157 --> 24:31.659
<i>in the 3-to-4-point range
this morning.</i>

24:31.951 --> 24:34.954
<i>We had an earthquake
in the 3-to-4-point range.</i>

24:35.079 --> 24:36.080
<i>I'm impressed.</i>

24:36.164 --> 24:37.248
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

24:37.748 --> 24:40.585
<i>However, isn't it rather
slender evidence...</i>

24:51.679 --> 24:53.639
You have such
beautiful skin.

24:56.934 --> 24:59.103
I like the way you...

25:01.939 --> 25:04.775
I don't know what I'm
supposed to do today, but...

25:27.924 --> 25:30.426
Antonio, <i>mira!</i>

25:31.594 --> 25:33.471
Watch what happens
to your friend.

25:33.596 --> 25:35.640
If you don't want this
to happen to you,

25:35.765 --> 25:37.308
give me the money.

25:56.160 --> 25:57.578
Come on, come on.

26:08.839 --> 26:10.508
Now the leg, huh.

26:23.312 --> 26:25.356
Let's do it, man.
Come on.

26:30.987 --> 26:32.989
We're all gonna
be all right.

26:44.041 --> 26:46.043
Okay, <i>cara cicatriz.</i>

26:46.836 --> 26:49.171
You can die, too.
It makes no difference to me.

26:55.720 --> 26:58.222
Last chance, <i>pendejo!</i>

26:58.889 --> 27:00.224
Fuck you!

28:08.417 --> 28:09.418
You okay?

28:09.502 --> 28:10.961
Yeah, man.
It went in and out.

28:22.306 --> 28:24.308
Okay, take him
out of here, quick!

28:24.433 --> 28:26.310
Chi Chi! Get the <i>yeyo.</i>

28:48.624 --> 28:49.875
Your turn.

28:49.959 --> 28:51.168
I kill you!

28:51.502 --> 28:52.503
Die!

29:06.142 --> 29:09.812
Hurry up! Get in!
Come on. Let's go!

29:10.187 --> 29:11.647
Close the door!

29:23.868 --> 29:27.496
Bunch of cowboys.
Somebody fucked up.

29:28.038 --> 29:30.207
<i>Yeah, well, I'll check
it out right away.</i>

29:30.332 --> 29:34.503
You do that, Omar.
You do that.

29:35.045 --> 29:36.130
<i>You still got
the money?</i>

29:36.213 --> 29:37.339
Yeah.

29:38.257 --> 29:40.342
And I got the <i>yeyo.</i>

29:41.010 --> 29:42.303
<i>You got the</i> yeyo?

29:42.386 --> 29:43.596
Yeah, right.

29:44.096 --> 29:45.097
<i>Bring it here.</i>

29:45.181 --> 29:46.182
Fuck you.

29:46.265 --> 29:48.684
I'm taking it
to Lopez myself.

29:49.894 --> 29:51.061
Not you, me.

30:09.914 --> 30:11.248
Nice fucking guy.

30:25.262 --> 30:27.389
Frank Lopez.
Tony Montana.

30:27.473 --> 30:28.891
Tony Montana.

30:28.974 --> 30:30.809
Mr. Lopez.
It's a real pleasure.

30:30.935 --> 30:32.228
You can call me Frank.

30:32.311 --> 30:34.939
Everybody calls me Frank.
My Little League team,

30:35.105 --> 30:37.608
even the fucking
prosecutors around town,

30:37.733 --> 30:38.859
they all call me Frank.

30:38.943 --> 30:40.611
Okay, Frank.
How are you?

30:40.736 --> 30:42.655
Manny Ribera.

30:42.947 --> 30:44.198
He caught one
on the job.

30:44.281 --> 30:45.407
Went right through.

30:45.491 --> 30:47.076
We heard about that.

30:47.159 --> 30:50.412
Omar, he tells me great
things about you guys.

30:52.081 --> 30:53.749
Well, Omar's okay.

30:53.832 --> 30:57.002
Not to mention, of course,
the nice job you did for me.

30:57.127 --> 30:59.129
That Commie
son of a bitch...

30:59.213 --> 31:00.756
You don't have
to mention that.

31:00.839 --> 31:02.675
That was fun.

31:02.758 --> 31:03.884
That was fun?

31:03.968 --> 31:05.219
Damn right.

31:05.302 --> 31:06.470
That was fun.

31:07.805 --> 31:09.598
Sometimes it's fun.

31:10.432 --> 31:12.101
What do you want
to drink?

31:12.184 --> 31:13.519
Scotch, gin, rum?
What do you like?

31:13.644 --> 31:16.772
Gin is fine.
Want some? Two gins.

31:17.022 --> 31:20.109
I need a guy with steel
in his balls, Tony.

31:20.192 --> 31:23.737
A guy like you.
And I need him around me all the time.

31:23.821 --> 31:27.199
You, Tony,
and your <i>compadre</i> here.

31:30.369 --> 31:31.829
Here's the stuff.

31:34.540 --> 31:35.666
Two keys.

31:37.209 --> 31:40.671
It cost my friend Angel his life.
Here's the money.

31:42.047 --> 31:43.716
My gift to you.

31:49.305 --> 31:51.640
I'm sorry about
your friend, Tony.

31:51.890 --> 31:53.976
If people would do
business the right way,

31:54.059 --> 31:56.687
there'd be no
fuck-ups like this.

31:58.731 --> 32:01.358
Don't think I don't
appreciate the gesture.

32:01.483 --> 32:04.361
You're gonna find,
you stay loyal in this business,

32:04.486 --> 32:07.823
you're gonna move up.
You're gonna move up fast.

32:15.205 --> 32:17.166
And you'll find out
your biggest problem

32:17.249 --> 32:19.209
is not bringing in
the stuff,

32:19.335 --> 32:21.295
but what to do with
all the fucking cash!

32:23.088 --> 32:25.007
I hope I have
that problem someday.

32:25.090 --> 32:26.925
You'll have that problem,
don't worry.

32:27.051 --> 32:29.011
Sit down over here.

32:31.221 --> 32:33.140
Where the hell's Elvira?

32:33.223 --> 32:35.142
It's late.
Go find her, will you?

32:35.225 --> 32:38.145
Jesus! Fucking broad.

32:38.228 --> 32:42.691
She spends half her life dressing,
the other half undressing.

32:43.942 --> 32:46.070
Gotta get her
in between.

32:46.779 --> 32:47.905
She's coming.

32:47.988 --> 32:49.073
Yeah.

32:49.198 --> 32:51.867
You gotta jump on her
when she's not looking.

32:51.950 --> 32:53.911
That's the best time.

32:56.413 --> 32:58.415
What are you
guys doing tonight?

32:58.540 --> 33:01.627
You wanna go to a nice
restaurant with me?
You hungry?

33:02.628 --> 33:03.837
I could eat a horse.

33:03.921 --> 33:05.673
Okay, they'll
cook you a horse.

33:05.756 --> 33:06.965
I'll eat it.

33:12.554 --> 33:15.224
Tell me,
where'd they get you?
Right there in the side?

33:15.307 --> 33:17.685
It's nothing.
It went right through me.

33:17.768 --> 33:18.811
It hit the wall.

33:18.936 --> 33:21.188
I ran out of bullets,
like an asshole.

33:21.271 --> 33:24.733
When I changed the clip,
a guy who I thought I killed

33:24.817 --> 33:26.985
wasn't dead
and shot me.

33:27.611 --> 33:29.488
The guy was behind me.
I killed him.

33:29.613 --> 33:30.823
How many bullets
you catch?

33:30.906 --> 33:32.032
Bullets? One bullet.

33:32.116 --> 33:33.409
9mm.

33:44.128 --> 33:46.422
Elvira,
where the hell you been?

33:46.505 --> 33:47.923
It's 10:00.
I'm starving.

33:48.006 --> 33:51.301
You're always hungry.
You should try starving.

33:52.302 --> 33:53.971
Where you going?
Come on.

33:54.096 --> 33:58.434
Come over here!
I want you to meet a friend of mine.

34:00.936 --> 34:03.147
Tony Montana. Elvira.

34:05.315 --> 34:06.442
Hello.

34:06.525 --> 34:07.860
Manny Ribera. Elvira.

34:08.026 --> 34:10.237
So, there are
five of us.

34:10.320 --> 34:11.739
Where are we
having dinner?

34:11.822 --> 34:14.324
I thought we'd go
to the Babylon Club.

34:14.616 --> 34:16.368
Again?
Again.

34:16.493 --> 34:19.830
You know, Frank,
if anyone wanted to assassinate you,

34:19.913 --> 34:22.166
you wouldn't be
too hard to find.

34:22.249 --> 34:25.419
Assassinate me?
Who the hell would want to kill me?

34:27.504 --> 34:29.506
I got nothing
but friends!

34:29.631 --> 34:31.425
You never know.

34:31.508 --> 34:33.510
Maybe the catcher on
your Little League team.

34:34.136 --> 34:36.346
The catcher?
That son of a bitch,

34:36.430 --> 34:37.848
he didn't get
a base hit all season.

34:37.931 --> 34:39.349
I should kill him!

35:46.208 --> 35:49.503
You know who that is?
Luis and Miguel Echevierra.

35:51.171 --> 35:54.508
They got the biggest distribution
setup from here to Houston,

35:54.591 --> 35:56.885
Tucson,
all down that way.

35:57.010 --> 35:58.762
What do you think
of that, huh?

36:00.848 --> 36:01.890
Look.

36:03.934 --> 36:07.521
You see that fat bastard?
That's Nacho Contreras.

36:07.688 --> 36:09.606
<i>El Gordo!</i>

36:09.690 --> 36:12.568
He's got more cash than
anybody in this place.

36:12.693 --> 36:15.237
He's a real <i>chazer!</i>

36:19.575 --> 36:22.035
You know what
a <i>chazer</i> is?

36:22.411 --> 36:24.705
No, Frank, you tell me.
What is a <i>chazer?</i>

36:24.788 --> 36:27.374
It's the Yiddish
word for "pig."

36:27.457 --> 36:30.502
A guy who wants
more than he needs.

36:30.586 --> 36:32.212
He don't fly
straight no more.

36:32.296 --> 36:34.882
So, it comes down
to one thing,

36:34.965 --> 36:37.718
Tony boy,
and you never forget it.

36:39.720 --> 36:41.889
Lesson Number 1:

36:43.432 --> 36:46.143
Don't underestimate

36:46.268 --> 36:48.645
the other guy's greed!

36:50.147 --> 36:51.315
Lesson Number 2:

36:51.440 --> 36:53.483
Don't get high on
your own supply.

36:54.484 --> 36:55.944
That's right.
Lesson Number 2:

36:56.028 --> 36:57.821
Don't get high on
your own supply.

36:57.946 --> 37:00.490
Course, not everybody
follows the rules.

37:05.996 --> 37:07.915
Your champagne,
Mr. Lopez.

37:07.998 --> 37:09.333
That is '64?

37:09.416 --> 37:10.751
The best, Mr. Lopez.

37:10.834 --> 37:12.419
Omar, you pour it,
and you bring

37:12.502 --> 37:14.296
another bottle
right away, will you?

37:14.463 --> 37:15.923
Pleasure, Mr. Lopez.

37:17.466 --> 37:21.637
$550 for this bottle, Tony.
What do you think of that?

37:21.762 --> 37:22.846
That's pretty good.

37:22.930 --> 37:25.349
For a bunch of
fucking grapes.

37:27.976 --> 37:32.022
So, here's to old friends
and to new friends.

37:41.114 --> 37:42.699
How you like it, Tony?

37:43.617 --> 37:45.535
That's good, Frank.
That's good?

37:45.619 --> 37:46.870
Like you say, man.

37:46.954 --> 37:48.163
That's good!

37:51.375 --> 37:54.127
I'm gonna get you
new clothes, too.

37:54.211 --> 37:57.172
I'm gonna get you
$550 suits,

37:57.881 --> 37:59.716
so you look real sharp.

38:00.550 --> 38:02.886
'Cause I want
you to work for me.

38:04.012 --> 38:08.392
I want you and your boys
to work with Omar here.

38:09.393 --> 38:14.481
We are going to do
something big next month.

38:15.899 --> 38:19.319
We are running a string
of mules from Colombia.

38:19.736 --> 38:23.323
You do good on that,
there'll be some other things.

38:25.242 --> 38:27.703
That sounds like
fun to me, Frank.

38:30.038 --> 38:31.415
You want a cigar?

38:34.501 --> 38:35.836
You wanna dance, Frank,

38:35.919 --> 38:38.672
or sit here and
have a heart attack?

38:43.260 --> 38:47.764
Who? Me, dance?
I want a heart attack instead.

38:50.100 --> 38:52.060
Don't foam into
the Dommie P.

38:58.400 --> 38:59.609
How about you?

39:04.072 --> 39:06.033
What? You want me
to dance?

39:06.116 --> 39:08.118
Yeah, sure.
Go on, Tony.
You dance.

39:08.452 --> 39:11.371
Go on.
Have some fun.

39:24.217 --> 39:26.053
What do you
think of him?

39:26.303 --> 39:28.430
I think he's
a fucking peasant!

39:32.809 --> 39:35.479
But you get a guy
like that on your side,

39:35.979 --> 39:38.273
he breaks his back
for you.

40:07.344 --> 40:08.386
What's your name?

40:08.470 --> 40:09.513
What?

40:10.680 --> 40:13.308
What's your name?
Elvira what?

40:13.475 --> 40:14.601
Hancock.

40:14.684 --> 40:15.769
What?

40:16.019 --> 40:17.145
Hancock!

40:17.229 --> 40:18.438
Hancock?

40:20.107 --> 40:23.110
Sounds like a bird.
Hancock.

40:23.443 --> 40:24.945
Flying around.

40:27.155 --> 40:28.365
Where you from?

40:29.199 --> 40:30.283
Baltimore.

40:30.367 --> 40:31.368
What?

40:31.535 --> 40:33.370
Baltimore!
Baltimore?

40:33.870 --> 40:34.830
Where's that?

40:34.913 --> 40:37.624
It doesn't
really matter, okay?

40:38.792 --> 40:41.378
I'm just trying
to be friendly.

40:41.503 --> 40:43.713
I don't need
another friend,

40:43.797 --> 40:46.133
especially one who just
got off a banana boat.

40:47.717 --> 40:49.469
Banana boat?

40:49.636 --> 40:51.346
Hold it.
You got the wrong guy.

40:51.429 --> 40:53.306
I don't come off
no banana boat.

40:55.016 --> 40:57.394
You're thinking
of someone else, maybe.

40:57.811 --> 40:59.896
Aren't you part
of the Cuban crime wave?

41:00.021 --> 41:04.359
What you talking crazy for?
I'm a political refugee here.

41:04.568 --> 41:06.111
So take it easy.
Don't talk crazy.

41:06.194 --> 41:07.487
Sorry.

41:07.821 --> 41:11.074
I didn't know you were so sensitive
about your diplomatic status.

41:11.158 --> 41:13.910
What is your problem, baby?

41:14.077 --> 41:15.245
You're good-looking.

41:15.370 --> 41:17.414
You got a beautiful body,
beautiful legs,

41:17.539 --> 41:20.000
a beautiful face,
all these guys in love with you.

41:20.083 --> 41:21.585
Only you got
a look in your eye

41:21.710 --> 41:24.379
like you haven't been
fucked in a year!

41:25.213 --> 41:26.965
Hey, JosÃ©.

41:27.048 --> 41:30.343
Who, why, when and how I fuck
is none of your business, okay?

41:30.427 --> 41:31.845
Now you're
talking to me, baby.

41:31.928 --> 41:33.680
That I like.
Keep it coming.

41:33.763 --> 41:36.892
Don't call me "baby"!
I'm not your baby.

41:37.601 --> 41:40.103
Not yet, but you gotta
give me some time.

41:42.564 --> 41:45.775
Even if I were blind,
desperate,

41:45.859 --> 41:48.195
starved and begging for it
on a desert island,

41:48.278 --> 41:50.614
you'd be the last thing
I'd ever fuck.

41:54.117 --> 41:55.952
That chick he's with...

41:56.620 --> 41:58.205
Yeah?
...she likes me.

41:59.956 --> 42:03.293
She likes you?
How do you know?

42:03.627 --> 42:04.794
I know.

42:06.254 --> 42:09.424
The eyes, <i>chico.</i>
They never lie.

42:12.886 --> 42:15.013
Are you serious?

42:15.096 --> 42:16.806
Serious?
What do you think?

42:16.973 --> 42:19.392
That's the boss's
lady, okay?

42:19.476 --> 42:20.560
You're gonna
get us killed.

42:20.644 --> 42:23.772
Fuck you, man.
The boss's lady.

42:24.814 --> 42:26.483
That guy's soft.

42:28.652 --> 42:30.111
Look in his face.

42:33.073 --> 42:35.784
The booze and the <i>concha</i>
tell him what to do.

42:38.411 --> 42:40.747
Don't fucking go
crazy on me, okay?

42:41.665 --> 42:43.250
Just remember last year
at this time

42:43.333 --> 42:45.502
we were in
a fucking cage, okay?

42:45.627 --> 42:47.003
You remember.

42:48.004 --> 42:49.798
I'd like
to forget that.

42:50.590 --> 42:52.634
I say be happy
with what you got.

42:52.717 --> 42:54.094
You be happy.

42:55.845 --> 42:57.430
Me, I want
what's coming to me.

42:57.514 --> 42:59.015
What's coming to you?

43:01.685 --> 43:03.645
The world, <i>chico,</i>

43:05.105 --> 43:07.023
and everything in it.

43:08.525 --> 43:09.609
Oh, man.

43:42.642 --> 43:44.185
This is paradise.

43:45.687 --> 43:47.981
This is paradise,
I'm telling you.

43:48.231 --> 43:52.736
This town's like a great big
pussy just waiting to get fucked.

43:54.195 --> 43:56.656
I should've come
here 10 years ago.

43:56.740 --> 43:59.576
I'd have been a
millionaire by this time.

44:00.702 --> 44:03.580
By this time,
I'd have had my own boat,

44:03.663 --> 44:06.082
my own car,
my own golf course.

44:06.166 --> 44:09.085
You know what I want?
I thought of this the other day.

44:09.210 --> 44:10.837
A line of blue jeans.

44:10.920 --> 44:14.090
With my name written on
the back of chicks' asses.

44:15.717 --> 44:16.885
How's that?

44:17.594 --> 44:20.013
That sounds
completely crazy to me.

44:21.598 --> 44:23.099
Look at that. Look.

44:23.266 --> 44:25.852
You're missing the sights.
That's what you're doing.

44:25.935 --> 44:27.228
We're missing
the action.

44:30.357 --> 44:32.859
Want to have some ice cream
with my friend and me?

44:32.942 --> 44:34.778
Get lost, greaseball!

44:35.904 --> 44:37.614
Look at that.
Ice cream?

44:37.739 --> 44:39.449
That's right.
You said "ice cream"?

44:39.574 --> 44:40.575
Girls like ice cream.

44:40.658 --> 44:42.786
Oh, come on.
That won't work.

44:42.869 --> 44:44.788
You can't
do it that way.

44:44.913 --> 44:47.791
You know how you pick up
chicks in this country?

44:51.795 --> 44:53.838
What was that?
What you just did?

44:53.922 --> 44:55.131
That's what you do.

44:55.965 --> 44:57.008
That's disgusting.

44:57.092 --> 44:58.051
Watch.

44:58.134 --> 45:00.970
Look at that fucking thing.
You look like a lizard.

45:01.096 --> 45:03.306
Like a bug coming
out of your mouth.

45:04.265 --> 45:06.393
Figures you
wouldn't understand.

45:06.476 --> 45:07.644
But the women
in this country,

45:07.727 --> 45:09.729
when you do that,
they know.

45:09.813 --> 45:10.772
They know what?

45:10.855 --> 45:12.774
They understand.
They go crazy.

45:13.775 --> 45:16.236
It'll take practice,
but you gotta learn.

45:16.319 --> 45:18.488
'Cause women love
when you suck the pussy.

45:18.571 --> 45:19.823
Look at that.

45:25.495 --> 45:27.080
She's looking at us.

45:29.958 --> 45:32.168
You think you
can do it with her?

45:32.252 --> 45:33.461
I think I can.

45:33.586 --> 45:35.088
You want to try it with her?

45:35.171 --> 45:36.339
Why not?

45:37.507 --> 45:39.050
You gonna watch me?

45:39.134 --> 45:40.844
I'm looking at you.
Go ahead.

45:40.969 --> 45:42.595
You won't do it.
Watch this.

45:43.930 --> 45:45.473
I'm with you, man.

45:46.182 --> 45:47.642
I'm gonna get her.

45:50.603 --> 45:52.939
Go ahead, Romeo!
Do your thing.

45:53.356 --> 45:54.441
Just be quiet.
Just hang back.

45:54.524 --> 45:55.817
Romeo!

46:01.489 --> 46:03.783
You're looking
very pretty today.

46:03.867 --> 46:05.368
Yes, you.
I've been watching you.

46:05.702 --> 46:07.620
You want to see
something funny?

46:07.704 --> 46:09.873
Take a look over there.
See that man?

46:10.039 --> 46:12.375
Watch that guy.
I gotta sit down here.

46:12.667 --> 46:13.793
I gotta watch my friend.

46:13.877 --> 46:16.546
He gonna stick his
tongue out to that girl.

46:16.671 --> 46:18.047
Oh, look at that.

46:19.048 --> 46:20.133
You're sick!

46:20.216 --> 46:22.469
You see what
happened to him?

46:22.886 --> 46:24.804
If I wasn't
a nice guy...

46:24.888 --> 46:26.514
She's too big for you.

46:26.890 --> 46:28.558
Causing trouble
like that, come on.

46:28.641 --> 46:31.060
Bitch! Lesbian!
What I try to tell you?

46:31.186 --> 46:32.562
What I try to tell you?

46:32.687 --> 46:35.565
This country,
you gotta make the money first.

46:36.858 --> 46:39.819
Then when you get the
money, you get the power.

46:39.903 --> 46:43.072
Then when you get the power,
then you get the women.

46:43.990 --> 46:45.992
That's why you gotta
make your own moves.

46:46.075 --> 46:47.744
That's the one I rented.

46:48.411 --> 46:52.081
No. That's her, man.
There she is.

46:52.582 --> 46:53.750
About time.

46:54.834 --> 46:57.170
Frank got held up
at the golf course.

46:57.253 --> 46:58.838
He told me
to pick you up.

46:59.506 --> 47:02.091
He said he'd meet us
at the track later.

47:05.094 --> 47:08.389
He said to bet on Ice Cream
in the first, by the way.

47:10.433 --> 47:13.228
In that thing?
You must be kidding.

47:14.938 --> 47:18.066
What you talking about?
That's a Cadillac.

47:19.776 --> 47:21.778
I wouldn't be
caught dead in that.

47:21.861 --> 47:22.946
Oh, come on.

47:23.696 --> 47:28.409
It's got a few years,
but it's a cream puff.

47:29.369 --> 47:31.579
It looks like
somebody's nightmare.

47:41.130 --> 47:43.424
So, you like
this better?

47:44.175 --> 47:45.301
Yeah.

47:46.052 --> 47:48.638
It's like one of them
tigers from India.

47:48.846 --> 47:50.890
Tigers, huh?
Tigers, no?

47:50.974 --> 47:52.892
Crazy guy. Know what
he's been doing?

47:52.976 --> 47:55.812
Dragging me to the zoo
to look at tigers.

47:56.062 --> 47:57.647
He says he's
gonna buy one.

47:57.772 --> 48:00.316
You do that and you won't
have any friends left.

48:00.400 --> 48:01.734
Not that you have
any now.

48:01.818 --> 48:03.570
You're gonna like
that tiger, man.

48:03.653 --> 48:06.573
You gonna drive around with a
tiger in your passenger seat?

48:06.656 --> 48:09.158
Maybe.
Some lady tiger.

48:12.579 --> 48:13.746
How much?

48:13.830 --> 48:15.331
43,000, fully equipped.

48:15.415 --> 48:17.041
That all?

48:17.125 --> 48:18.835
Machine-gun
turrets are extra.

48:19.002 --> 48:22.005
He's a funny guy.
Come here, Manny.

48:23.923 --> 48:26.342
Bulletproof this, okay?

48:26.426 --> 48:28.511
And this here and here.

48:29.512 --> 48:31.014
- Okay.
- And the windows.

48:33.516 --> 48:36.769
Get me a phone
with a scrambler.

48:36.853 --> 48:38.104
A scrambler.

48:38.187 --> 48:40.690
And a radio
with scanners

48:40.773 --> 48:42.775
to pick up flying saucers,
stuff like that.

48:42.859 --> 48:44.527
Don't forget
the fog lights.

48:44.611 --> 48:48.531
Oh. In case I get caught in a swamp.
That's a good idea.

48:51.618 --> 48:54.621
Get out of the way, lady!
I'm trying to drive here!

48:56.039 --> 48:58.374
I thought you were
taking me to Frank.

49:04.005 --> 49:06.507
We got an hour.
You hungry?

49:08.217 --> 49:10.011
No, but I'm bored.

49:11.054 --> 49:12.722
Well, that figures.

49:14.891 --> 49:18.186
Check it out, Manny, okay?
And pay the guy.

49:18.478 --> 49:21.689
And you take a taxi.
Meet me at the track, okay?

49:21.856 --> 49:23.566
Good doing business with you.
Mr. Montana.

49:24.942 --> 49:26.402
Oh, God, man!

49:28.988 --> 49:31.407
I wouldn't buy the car
if you didn't like it.

49:31.491 --> 49:34.243
Planning on driving the girls
crazy, aren't you, Tony?

49:34.369 --> 49:36.579
Oh, yeah.
You know who?

49:38.706 --> 49:40.500
What would Frank say?

49:42.877 --> 49:44.587
I like Frank,
you know?

49:45.088 --> 49:46.923
Only I like you better.

49:54.764 --> 49:55.932
You got some for me?

49:56.015 --> 49:57.100
Sure.

50:04.774 --> 50:05.942
Okay.

50:12.448 --> 50:13.574
Okay.

50:15.410 --> 50:18.037
Don't get confused, Tony.

50:18.121 --> 50:20.206
I don't fuck around
with the help.

50:27.755 --> 50:31.592
You wanna play that way with
me, I play with you.

50:31.718 --> 50:32.927
Shit.

50:33.553 --> 50:35.304
Would you kiss me
if I wear the hat?

50:35.388 --> 50:36.472
No!

50:38.725 --> 50:40.101
Playtime is over, okay?

50:43.646 --> 50:44.772
Okay.

51:38.159 --> 51:39.452
Mama?

51:41.204 --> 51:42.455
Antonio.

51:42.789 --> 51:44.040
Long time.

51:46.876 --> 51:48.628
No postcards
from jail, huh?

51:59.472 --> 52:00.640
Gina.

52:02.391 --> 52:03.810
Tony?

52:03.893 --> 52:05.228
Look at you.

52:07.146 --> 52:08.689
You're beautiful.

52:09.398 --> 52:10.399
I didn't...

52:10.483 --> 52:12.151
Mama, look at
those eyes, huh.

52:12.401 --> 52:13.986
Look at that.
She looks like me.

52:15.363 --> 52:18.241
You know the last time I saw
you, you was like that.

52:18.324 --> 52:21.828
You looked like a little boy.
Now look at you.

52:26.207 --> 52:28.084
I got something
for you.

52:33.214 --> 52:35.049
It's no big deal.

52:37.051 --> 52:38.052
Oh, Tony!

52:49.689 --> 52:51.941
I never thought I'd see you
again, you know?

52:52.066 --> 52:54.193
You think they'd keep
a guy like me down?

52:54.277 --> 52:55.778
Well, no.

53:00.074 --> 53:01.742
You look so good.

53:01.826 --> 53:05.037
Look, open that up.
Open it.

53:05.705 --> 53:06.831
For me?

53:06.914 --> 53:07.957
I think so.

53:09.208 --> 53:12.587
It's nothing much,
you know, nothing.

53:17.550 --> 53:19.051
See what's
written on the back?

53:19.135 --> 53:21.429
On the back? Aw.

53:22.388 --> 53:23.389
Always.

53:23.472 --> 53:26.309
"Always."
It's beautiful, Tony!

53:27.894 --> 53:29.979
Mama is still working
in the factory,

53:30.104 --> 53:32.231
and I work part-time
in a beauty parlor.

53:32.315 --> 53:35.401
I'm doing hair, Tony.
Do you remember Hiram Gonzalez?

53:35.651 --> 53:38.404
His father owned that barbershop.
It's his place.

53:38.487 --> 53:41.115
Plus I go to junior college.
Miami Dade.

53:41.282 --> 53:44.327
In two more years,
I get my cosmetology license.

53:44.410 --> 53:46.287
Then I'll be
making enough money...

53:46.370 --> 53:47.663
Surprise!

53:48.289 --> 53:51.000
All that's over,
starting today.

53:51.459 --> 53:52.501
Why?

53:52.585 --> 53:54.420
My kid sister
don't have to work

53:54.503 --> 53:57.256
in no beauty parlor,
and Mama,

53:57.840 --> 54:00.301
she don't have to
sew in no factory.

54:00.593 --> 54:02.678
Your son made it, Mama.

54:04.138 --> 54:05.473
He's a success.

54:06.641 --> 54:09.018
That's why I didn't
come around before.

54:09.977 --> 54:13.856
I want you to see what
a good boy I've been.

54:16.317 --> 54:17.777
Here's $1,000.

54:18.527 --> 54:19.987
For you, Mama.

54:27.828 --> 54:29.288
Who did you kill
for this, Antonio?

54:29.372 --> 54:30.498
Mama.

54:30.873 --> 54:32.833
I didn't kill nobody, Mama.

54:33.793 --> 54:34.877
No?
No.

54:35.878 --> 54:37.880
What are you doing now?

54:38.464 --> 54:41.550
Banks,
or is it still bodegas,
you and the others?

54:41.634 --> 54:43.886
No! Things are
different now.

54:43.970 --> 54:46.806
I'm working with
an anti-Castro group.

54:47.181 --> 54:48.808
I'm an organizer now.

54:48.891 --> 54:51.185
I get a lot of
political contributions.

54:52.228 --> 54:53.729
Sure you do.

54:58.067 --> 55:01.153
A gun sticking in
somebody's face is how.

55:02.780 --> 55:05.783
You know,
all we hear about in the papers

55:07.618 --> 55:10.579
is animals like you
and the killings.

55:11.288 --> 55:14.583
It's Cubans like you who are
giving a bad name to our people,

55:14.667 --> 55:16.335
people who come here,
work hard

55:16.419 --> 55:18.004
and make a good name
for themselves.

55:18.087 --> 55:20.047
People who send their
children to school.

55:20.131 --> 55:21.841
What are you saying?
That's your son...

55:21.924 --> 55:25.011
Son? I wish I had one.

55:25.845 --> 55:26.846
He's a bum.
No.

55:26.971 --> 55:29.807
He was a bum then
and he's a bum now.

55:31.809 --> 55:33.602
Who do you think
you are?

55:34.478 --> 55:35.604
Mmm?

55:36.147 --> 55:39.108
We haven't heard a word
from you in five years.

55:42.194 --> 55:44.905
You suddenly show up here,
throw some money around

55:44.989 --> 55:47.450
and think you
can get my respect.

55:48.034 --> 55:50.786
You think you can
buy me with jewelry?

55:50.870 --> 55:54.457
You think you can come into my
house with your hotshot clothes

55:54.540 --> 55:57.043
and your jail manners
and make fun of us?

55:57.126 --> 55:59.045
You don't know
what you're saying.

55:59.128 --> 56:01.297
That's not the way
I am, Antonio!

56:01.464 --> 56:03.966
That is not the way
I raised Gina to be!

56:06.135 --> 56:08.554
You are not
going to destroy her.

56:10.222 --> 56:11.974
I don't need
your money.

56:14.060 --> 56:15.895
I work for my living.

56:16.479 --> 56:19.023
I don't want you
in this house anymore!

56:19.482 --> 56:21.484
I don't want you
around Gina.

56:22.359 --> 56:25.071
So come on.
Get out!

56:31.243 --> 56:32.244
Okay.

56:35.748 --> 56:36.874
Mama...

56:36.957 --> 56:40.961
And take this lousy money
with you. It stinks.

56:41.212 --> 56:42.338
Tony.

56:43.672 --> 56:46.509
Why do you have to spoil
it for everybody, huh?

56:49.178 --> 56:50.846
I'm sorry, Tony.

56:52.556 --> 56:53.933
Okay, Mama.

56:58.229 --> 56:59.730
No. Tony,
wait a minute!

56:59.855 --> 57:00.898
Don't go, please!

57:00.981 --> 57:02.024
Gina, stay here!

57:02.233 --> 57:03.275
No, Mama.

57:03.359 --> 57:04.360
He's no good. Gina!

57:05.694 --> 57:07.530
Tony, wait, please!

57:08.114 --> 57:10.241
I'm sorry.
I don't know.

57:10.324 --> 57:12.576
Mama, ever since
Papa left, she's...

57:12.701 --> 57:14.870
Forget Papa.
We never had one.

57:15.037 --> 57:17.581
I know you did some
bad things back then.

57:17.873 --> 57:20.543
In the Army,
I know you got into some trouble.

57:20.626 --> 57:22.378
The Communists,

57:22.461 --> 57:24.547
they're always trying
to tell you what to do.

57:24.630 --> 57:26.173
Mama doesn't
understand that.

57:26.257 --> 57:27.466
I know.

57:29.093 --> 57:31.679
I just...
I don't know.

57:31.762 --> 57:34.390
I just want you to know
that I don't care.

57:34.640 --> 57:35.933
It doesn't matter
to me how long

57:36.016 --> 57:38.561
you've been away,
five or ten years.

57:40.604 --> 57:43.816
You're my blood, always.

57:45.025 --> 57:47.570
I know.

57:56.662 --> 57:58.664
Come on.
I want you to take this.

57:58.747 --> 57:59.832
I gotta go back in.

57:59.957 --> 58:01.208
No, Tony. Please.

58:01.292 --> 58:02.668
You need this.

58:02.751 --> 58:04.086
What will I tell her?

58:04.170 --> 58:05.921
Take that.
You don't tell her anything.

58:06.005 --> 58:07.339
Don't tell her
I gave it to you,

58:07.423 --> 58:09.550
but give her some
from time to time.

58:09.633 --> 58:12.261
And listen,
you go out yourself.

58:12.344 --> 58:15.764
Go ahead.
Go out, do some things.
Have some fun.

58:15.931 --> 58:18.100
You gotta get
some fun out of life.

58:18.184 --> 58:21.020
You gonna beat yourself
to death at 19?

58:21.103 --> 58:23.606
A pussycat like you?
Come here.

58:28.027 --> 58:29.904
I'll talk to you again.
Okay.

58:29.987 --> 58:32.114
Put that money away.
Don't let her see it.

58:32.198 --> 58:33.699
I'll talk to her.

58:35.618 --> 58:37.036
I'll talk to you.
Okay.

58:39.163 --> 58:40.247
Let's go.

58:42.249 --> 58:43.542
She's beautiful.
How come you...

58:43.626 --> 58:44.877
Hey!

58:47.338 --> 58:51.383
Stay away from her.
You hear?

58:52.176 --> 58:53.719
She's not for you.

58:53.802 --> 58:54.845
Okay.

59:20.329 --> 59:22.122
So, this and my
other factory,

59:22.206 --> 59:23.415
I can guarantee production

59:23.499 --> 59:27.586
of 200 kilos refined
every month of the year.

59:28.003 --> 59:30.256
The problem is,
I have no steady market.

59:30.339 --> 59:33.759
Basically, what I'm looking
for is somebody in the States

59:33.842 --> 59:36.053
who can share
the risk with me,

59:36.136 --> 59:37.263
somebody
who can guarantee

59:37.346 --> 59:41.517
to buy from me, say,
150 kilos a month.

59:41.934 --> 59:46.272
Oh, that's a big commitment, Mr. Sosa.
Something like that...

59:47.356 --> 59:49.692
Too bad Frank's not here.
You should talk to him.

59:49.775 --> 59:51.694
It would've been
nice if he'd come.

59:51.777 --> 59:52.861
He would like to come,

59:52.945 --> 59:55.114
but with his trial
coming up,

59:55.197 --> 59:57.533
it's hard to
leave the country.

59:57.616 --> 59:59.451
So he sent
you instead?

59:59.535 --> 01:00:01.036
Something like that.

01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:03.372
We'll talk at my house,
shall we?

01:00:03.998 --> 01:00:07.376
You got good stuff here.
Class-A shit.

01:00:29.231 --> 01:00:32.985
This Lopez guarantees
to buy 150 kilos from me

01:00:33.068 --> 01:00:34.403
every month
of the year.

01:00:34.486 --> 01:00:35.654
He picks it up here.

01:00:35.738 --> 01:00:38.032
I can sell it to him
for as little as

01:00:39.908 --> 01:00:43.412
7,000 a key.
You can't do better than that.

01:00:44.246 --> 01:00:47.082
But then we got to take
the risk of moving it.

01:00:47.249 --> 01:00:50.252
We'll be cutting out the Colombians.
Know what that means?

01:00:50.336 --> 01:00:52.254
That means we have to
go to war with them.

01:00:52.338 --> 01:00:55.924
We cut out the Colombians,
we take risks on both sides.

01:00:56.008 --> 01:00:57.885
Why don't we split the risk?

01:00:59.553 --> 01:01:03.098
You guarantee your delivery,
say, as far as Panama,

01:01:03.932 --> 01:01:05.684
we take it from there.

01:01:08.020 --> 01:01:11.440
Panama is risky.
It costs me more.

01:01:13.108 --> 01:01:17.363
Panama I can sell
for 13.5 a key.

01:01:18.614 --> 01:01:21.116
13.5?
What, are you nuts?

01:01:22.743 --> 01:01:26.372
13.5? We still got to
take that shit to Florida.

01:01:26.455 --> 01:01:28.540
Do you know what
that's like these days?

01:01:28.624 --> 01:01:30.751
You got the Navy everywhere.

01:01:30.918 --> 01:01:32.878
You got frogmen.

01:01:32.961 --> 01:01:35.255
You got EC2s with
the satellite-tracking shit.

01:01:35.881 --> 01:01:39.134
You got the fucking Bell 209
assault choppers up the ass.

01:01:39.635 --> 01:01:42.137
We're losing one
out of every nine loads.

01:01:43.097 --> 01:01:45.974
That's no duckwalk anymore,
let me tell you.

01:01:46.225 --> 01:01:47.643
Forget about 13.5.

01:01:51.230 --> 01:01:53.982
What do you suggest
that is reasonable?

01:01:59.571 --> 01:02:01.615
Excuse me.
One moment.

01:02:06.078 --> 01:02:08.414
What the fuck's
the matter with you?

01:02:08.497 --> 01:02:10.165
Are you negotiating
for Frank Lopez?

01:02:10.249 --> 01:02:12.501
Don't worry about it.
Take it easy.

01:02:12.584 --> 01:02:15.629
I'm not worried about it.
You should worry about it.

01:02:16.171 --> 01:02:19.007
If he wants to make a deal,
it's up to him, not you.

01:02:19.133 --> 01:02:20.676
We're doing this
one deal. That's it.

01:02:20.801 --> 01:02:22.678
Fuck you.
How's that?

01:02:23.846 --> 01:02:25.597
Fuck you.
Fuck you.

01:02:25.681 --> 01:02:28.434
You need to open your eyes
and keep your mouth shut.

01:02:28.517 --> 01:02:29.977
That's it.
Let it go at that.

01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:31.437
Don't worry about it.

01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:33.480
Your head's in
the wrong place.

01:02:33.564 --> 01:02:34.857
You must watch
out for yourself.

01:02:34.940 --> 01:02:36.108
Why not talk to him?

01:02:36.191 --> 01:02:38.193
You think he wants
to give you the money?

01:02:38.277 --> 01:02:39.695
Shut the fuck up.

01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:41.864
I'm doing
the talking here, not you.

01:02:42.698 --> 01:02:45.367
You're here to watch my back.
Watch my back.

01:02:46.827 --> 01:02:48.787
Better than your front,
let me tell you.

01:02:48.871 --> 01:02:50.372
That's easier to watch.

01:02:50.456 --> 01:02:51.874
Close your mouth.

01:02:52.207 --> 01:02:55.502
I can't wait to see what
Frank's gonna react to this one.

01:02:56.044 --> 01:02:58.672
Just shut up. I'm doing
the talking here.

01:02:59.882 --> 01:03:01.133
Now where were we?

01:03:01.216 --> 01:03:02.384
Panama.

01:03:02.843 --> 01:03:05.053
You're looking for
a partner, right?

01:03:06.430 --> 01:03:07.973
Something like that.

01:03:08.056 --> 01:03:11.560
Look, Mr. Sosa,
we're getting ahead of ourselves.

01:03:12.227 --> 01:03:16.773
I am down on Frank's authority
to buy 200 keys, that's it.

01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:18.984
That's my limit.
I got no right.

01:03:19.067 --> 01:03:20.277
Nobody got no right
to negotiate...

01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:22.154
Let the man
finish, okay?

01:03:22.237 --> 01:03:24.948
Let him propose a proposition,
then we can talk more.

01:03:25.073 --> 01:03:27.034
You got no
authority here.

01:03:27.117 --> 01:03:29.912
I started you in this
business, so shut the fuck up.

01:03:30.037 --> 01:03:32.456
Frank is gonna love it.

01:03:32.539 --> 01:03:34.041
That's up to Frank,
not you!

01:03:37.586 --> 01:03:39.630
I'm sorry about this,
Mr. Sosa.

01:03:40.088 --> 01:03:41.632
No, it is all right.

01:03:42.216 --> 01:03:45.427
You're right.
Maybe you should talk to Frank.

01:03:48.305 --> 01:03:49.431
Well, good.

01:03:50.766 --> 01:03:53.936
I don't think it's something I
want to do on an overseas phone.

01:03:54.228 --> 01:03:57.189
But as soon as
I get back to Miami,

01:03:57.272 --> 01:03:59.107
I will talk to
Frank personally.

01:04:00.275 --> 01:04:01.276
Good.

01:04:02.069 --> 01:04:04.446
My associates can
escort you to my chopper

01:04:04.571 --> 01:04:06.240
to take you
to Santa Cruz.

01:04:06.323 --> 01:04:09.409
I have a jet there.
You'll be in Miami in five hours.

01:04:09.493 --> 01:04:12.496
You'll be back here
tomorrow in time for lunch.

01:04:14.122 --> 01:04:15.541
Good.

01:04:19.002 --> 01:04:20.629
Good talking to you.

01:04:21.672 --> 01:04:23.799
Why not leave
your friend here?

01:04:23.924 --> 01:04:26.677
While you're gone,
he can tell me how
to run my business.

01:04:26.802 --> 01:04:28.470
I think Frank
wants to see him.

01:04:28.554 --> 01:04:29.846
No, that's okay.

01:04:29.972 --> 01:04:33.642
You tell Frank I'm keeping
this guy on ice for him.

01:04:36.395 --> 01:04:37.938
I guess so.

01:04:41.191 --> 01:04:43.026
Let's finish
our lunch.

01:04:47.531 --> 01:04:49.741
I have to hand it
to you, Mr. Sosa.

01:04:51.118 --> 01:04:53.370
You got everything
a man could want.

01:04:55.330 --> 01:04:58.125
I like you, Tony.
There is no lying in you.

01:04:59.710 --> 01:05:01.503
Unfortunately,
I don't feel the same

01:05:01.587 --> 01:05:03.880
about the rest of
your organization.

01:05:07.426 --> 01:05:09.678
What do you mean
by that, Mr. Sosa?

01:05:10.345 --> 01:05:12.764
I'm talking
about Omar Suarez.

01:05:15.475 --> 01:05:18.979
This garbage was recognized
by my associate at lunch

01:05:19.938 --> 01:05:22.316
from several years ago
in New York.

01:05:26.612 --> 01:05:28.739
He was an informer
for the police.

01:05:46.590 --> 01:05:50.886
He put Vito Duval and Nello
and Gino Ramos away for life.

01:05:55.474 --> 01:05:58.310
So how do I know you're not a
<i>chivato,</i> too, Tony?

01:06:01.730 --> 01:06:02.731
Hey, Sosa.

01:06:05.359 --> 01:06:07.611
Let's get this
straight now.

01:06:09.321 --> 01:06:13.492
I've never fucked anybody over
who didn't have it coming.

01:06:13.742 --> 01:06:15.118
You got that?

01:06:16.078 --> 01:06:19.873
All I have in this world
is my balls and my word.

01:06:19.998 --> 01:06:23.377
I don't break them for no
one, you understand?

01:06:24.503 --> 01:06:27.130
That piece of shit up
there, I never liked him,

01:06:27.214 --> 01:06:28.715
I never trusted him.

01:06:28.924 --> 01:06:30.926
For all I know,
he had me set up

01:06:31.009 --> 01:06:33.387
and had my friend
Angel Fernandez killed.

01:06:33.470 --> 01:06:35.889
But that's history.
I'm here, he's not.

01:06:35.972 --> 01:06:38.350
You want to go on
with me, say it.

01:06:38.433 --> 01:06:41.186
You don't,
then you make a move.

01:06:46.858 --> 01:06:49.528
I think you speak
from the heart, Montana.

01:06:49.611 --> 01:06:51.029
But I say to myself,

01:06:52.114 --> 01:06:54.116
"This Lopez, your boss,

01:06:55.158 --> 01:06:58.036
"he had <i>chivatos</i> like
that working for him."

01:06:58.954 --> 01:07:00.580
His judgment stinks.

01:07:03.083 --> 01:07:05.085
So I think to myself,

01:07:05.502 --> 01:07:08.505
"How many other mistakes
has this Lopez guy made?

01:07:10.924 --> 01:07:14.886
"How can I trust his organization?"
You tell me, Tony.

01:07:17.222 --> 01:07:20.100
Frank is smart,
you know?

01:07:22.561 --> 01:07:24.813
You can't blame him
for that animal.

01:07:26.022 --> 01:07:28.817
It's a crazy business
we're in, you know?

01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:31.653
That could happen
to anyone, even you.

01:07:38.118 --> 01:07:40.996
Why don't I go back
and talk to Frank

01:07:41.955 --> 01:07:43.457
and work it out?

01:07:44.332 --> 01:07:46.293
I'll fix things
between us.

01:07:48.211 --> 01:07:49.838
You got my word on that.

01:07:51.465 --> 01:07:54.342
I think you and me,
we can work this thing out,

01:07:54.968 --> 01:07:57.387
we do business together
a long time.

01:07:59.389 --> 01:08:00.724
Just remember,

01:08:01.725 --> 01:08:03.894
I'll only tell you
one time,

01:08:05.145 --> 01:08:07.063
don't fuck me, Tony.

01:08:09.691 --> 01:08:11.693
Don't you ever
try to fuck me.

01:08:25.540 --> 01:08:26.833
You what?

01:08:29.044 --> 01:08:32.547
You made a deal
for fucking $18 million

01:08:32.631 --> 01:08:33.965
without even
checking with me?

01:08:34.049 --> 01:08:36.134
Are you crazy, Montana?
Are you crazy?

01:08:36.218 --> 01:08:38.011
<i>CoÃ±o</i>. Take it easy.
<i>CoÃ±o,</i> my ass!

01:08:38.094 --> 01:08:41.223
At 10.5 a key,
it's <i>puro.</i>

01:08:42.766 --> 01:08:45.101
You can't lose money.
No way.

01:08:47.103 --> 01:08:50.607
We make 75 million
on this deal.

01:08:51.483 --> 01:08:53.652
75 million.

01:08:54.861 --> 01:08:56.696
That is serious money.

01:08:56.988 --> 01:08:58.824
What is Sosa
going to do

01:08:58.907 --> 01:09:01.201
when I don't come up
with the first 5 million?

01:09:01.284 --> 01:09:04.079
What is he going to do?
Will he send me a bill?

01:09:04.162 --> 01:09:06.498
He'll send
a hit squad up here!

01:09:06.581 --> 01:09:07.624
There'll be
a war in the street.

01:09:07.707 --> 01:09:11.461
Relax! Take it easy.
I'm in tight with Sosa.

01:09:13.296 --> 01:09:16.424
You short a couple of mil,
I go on the street for you.

01:09:16.591 --> 01:09:18.468
I make a couple
of moves,

01:09:19.177 --> 01:09:21.555
a mil here, a mil there,
you got it.

01:09:23.306 --> 01:09:24.432
Okay?

01:09:27.310 --> 01:09:29.646
You've been making moves
on your own?

01:09:31.857 --> 01:09:34.860
I got ears, you know.
I hear things.

01:09:38.613 --> 01:09:41.575
What do you hear about
Echevierra and the Diaz brothers?

01:09:41.658 --> 01:09:43.869
What about Gomez?

01:09:43.952 --> 01:09:46.288
What'll he do when you
start moving 2,000 keys...

01:09:46.371 --> 01:09:50.292
Fuck Gaspar Gomez and
fuck the Diaz brothers!

01:09:50.375 --> 01:09:51.626
Fuck them all!

01:09:52.377 --> 01:09:54.713
I'll bury
those cockroaches!

01:09:56.298 --> 01:09:58.049
What they ever do for us?

01:10:05.849 --> 01:10:08.852
Look, Frank,
the time has come.

01:10:10.353 --> 01:10:12.022
We gotta expand.

01:10:12.814 --> 01:10:15.692
The whole operation.
Distribution.

01:10:16.985 --> 01:10:20.030
New York, Chicago, LA.

01:10:21.823 --> 01:10:24.576
We gotta set our own mark
and enforce it.

01:10:25.493 --> 01:10:27.162
We gotta think big now.

01:10:31.833 --> 01:10:33.043
Think big.

01:10:39.049 --> 01:10:40.759
Like your friend Sosa.

01:10:43.178 --> 01:10:46.514
Let me tell you something about
that greaseball cocksucker.

01:10:47.057 --> 01:10:49.684
He is a snake,
that's what he is.

01:10:51.519 --> 01:10:55.440
You turn your back on
him, he'll stick it in.

01:10:56.274 --> 01:10:58.360
You don't trust
a guy like that.

01:10:59.861 --> 01:11:02.113
You want me
to believe

01:11:02.822 --> 01:11:06.910
Omar was a stoolie
because Sosa said so?

01:11:07.410 --> 01:11:08.954
You bought that line?

01:11:10.246 --> 01:11:13.083
Maybe I made a mistake
sending you down there.

01:11:14.542 --> 01:11:17.754
Maybe you and Sosa know
something I don't know.

01:11:20.882 --> 01:11:22.050
Like what?

01:11:23.259 --> 01:11:24.678
Like what?

01:11:26.304 --> 01:11:28.431
You tell me,
"Like what."

01:11:32.644 --> 01:11:35.188
You calling me
a liar, Frank?

01:11:36.231 --> 01:11:37.983
That what you're
calling me?

01:11:43.989 --> 01:11:45.615
Let's just say
I want things

01:11:45.699 --> 01:11:47.742
to stay the way
they are for now.

01:11:51.079 --> 01:11:53.665
You stall your deal
with Sosa.

01:11:55.375 --> 01:11:56.668
Stall it?

01:12:01.131 --> 01:12:02.590
Okay, boss.

01:12:03.258 --> 01:12:04.300
Come on.

01:12:06.803 --> 01:12:08.013
I am the boss.

01:12:09.389 --> 01:12:10.557
Sure, you're the boss.

01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:11.808
Hey, Tony.

01:12:16.187 --> 01:12:18.773
Remember I told you
when you started,

01:12:18.940 --> 01:12:21.443
the guys who last
in this business

01:12:22.318 --> 01:12:24.529
are the guys
who fly straight,

01:12:25.822 --> 01:12:27.323
low-key, quiet.

01:12:28.616 --> 01:12:30.660
And the guys
who want it all,

01:12:31.369 --> 01:12:34.664
<i>chicas,</i> champagne, flash,

01:12:36.624 --> 01:12:38.084
they don't last.

01:12:39.586 --> 01:12:40.879
You finished?

01:12:41.796 --> 01:12:43.006
Can I go now?

01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:07.030
Hi, there.

01:13:14.370 --> 01:13:15.997
You just missed Frank.

01:13:19.167 --> 01:13:20.293
Too bad.

01:13:22.670 --> 01:13:24.756
Only I didn't
come to see Frank.

01:13:26.299 --> 01:13:29.219
This is not the time
or the place, Tony.

01:13:29.719 --> 01:13:31.179
Next time,
make an appointment.

01:13:31.262 --> 01:13:32.305
That's okay.

01:13:32.388 --> 01:13:35.517
I got something important I
want to talk to you about.

01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:45.026
So why don't we have
a couple of drinks,

01:13:45.485 --> 01:13:46.861
act normal,

01:13:49.197 --> 01:13:50.990
and just take it easy?

01:13:51.825 --> 01:13:53.701
Come on.
I like Scotch.

01:13:58.623 --> 01:13:59.999
Sure. Why not?

01:14:00.083 --> 01:14:01.876
Okay.
I won't bite you.

01:14:04.546 --> 01:14:06.548
We're all normal here.

01:14:10.301 --> 01:14:14.013
I heard you and Frank aren't
working together anymore.

01:14:14.389 --> 01:14:15.723
That's right.

01:14:20.311 --> 01:14:22.564
I think it's easier,
don't you?

01:14:23.314 --> 01:14:25.024
Makes things easier.

01:14:27.569 --> 01:14:28.695
Thank you.

01:14:30.029 --> 01:14:32.157
Here's to
the land of opportunity.

01:14:33.199 --> 01:14:34.659
For you, maybe.

01:14:39.747 --> 01:14:40.915
You like kids?

01:14:42.834 --> 01:14:43.877
Kids?

01:14:44.502 --> 01:14:46.754
Kids. You know, kids.
Little kids.

01:14:48.506 --> 01:14:50.592
Sure. Why not?

01:14:51.009 --> 01:14:52.510
As long as
there's a nurse.

01:14:52.594 --> 01:14:55.555
Good, 'cause
I like kids, too.

01:14:57.515 --> 01:15:01.603
I like them. Boys, girls.
Don't matter to me.

01:15:04.939 --> 01:15:07.066
Frank's gonna be
back any minute.

01:15:07.609 --> 01:15:09.068
Come here.

01:15:16.117 --> 01:15:17.118
Sit here.

01:15:18.036 --> 01:15:19.454
I want to talk to you.
Sit down.

01:15:19.537 --> 01:15:21.289
I'm not gonna bite you.

01:15:27.295 --> 01:15:29.088
Okay, here's the story.

01:15:32.383 --> 01:15:35.553
I come from the gutter.
I know that.

01:15:37.931 --> 01:15:41.976
I got no education,
but that's okay.

01:15:43.311 --> 01:15:45.480
I know the street,

01:15:45.563 --> 01:15:48.066
and I'm making
all the right connections.

01:15:49.150 --> 01:15:52.737
With the right woman,
there's no stopping me.

01:15:53.488 --> 01:15:55.615
I could go
right to the top.

01:15:57.742 --> 01:16:01.829
Anyway, what I got
to tell you is this,

01:16:03.998 --> 01:16:05.583
I like you.

01:16:08.836 --> 01:16:11.673
I liked you the first time
I laid eyes on you.

01:16:14.842 --> 01:16:17.595
I said, "She's a tiger.

01:16:19.847 --> 01:16:21.849
"She'll belong to me."

01:16:25.853 --> 01:16:27.272
Anyway,

01:16:28.523 --> 01:16:30.358
I want you
to marry me.

01:16:33.444 --> 01:16:36.364
I want you to be the
mother of my children.

01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:42.203
Me? Marry you?

01:16:42.328 --> 01:16:43.538
That's right.

01:16:48.293 --> 01:16:50.044
What about Frank, Tony?

01:16:50.712 --> 01:16:52.297
What will you do
about Frank?

01:16:52.380 --> 01:16:55.967
Frank is not gonna last, okay?
He's finished.

01:16:58.303 --> 01:17:00.888
Just think
about it, okay?

01:17:02.181 --> 01:17:04.559
I want you to
really think about it.

01:17:07.186 --> 01:17:10.189
I'll go now.
Take care.

01:17:18.906 --> 01:17:20.533
All your enemies
are gone.

01:17:22.035 --> 01:17:23.286
Mr. Montana.
How are you?

01:17:23.369 --> 01:17:24.579
Hello.

01:17:32.378 --> 01:17:34.297
What the fuck
she doing here?

01:17:34.422 --> 01:17:36.924
Come on, man.
She's just dancing.

01:17:37.008 --> 01:17:38.760
Come on.
Take it easy.

01:17:51.814 --> 01:17:54.150
It's just a disco.

01:17:54.233 --> 01:17:55.443
Who's that guy
she's with?

01:17:56.652 --> 01:17:59.030
He's some guy who works for Luco.
He's nobody.

01:17:59.113 --> 01:18:00.823
He's harmless.
Works for Luco?

01:18:00.907 --> 01:18:03.368
Yeah. Forget him.

01:18:05.286 --> 01:18:09.207
Hello, Tony.
You remember me?

01:18:11.626 --> 01:18:15.505
Bernstein.
Mel Bernstein, right?

01:18:16.381 --> 01:18:18.508
Chief Detective,
Narcotics.

01:18:19.467 --> 01:18:22.095
That's right, yeah.
I think we should talk.

01:18:22.762 --> 01:18:25.390
Talk? What are we
going to talk about?

01:18:25.932 --> 01:18:28.935
I ain't killed nobody,
not lately.

01:18:29.352 --> 01:18:31.145
No, not lately.

01:18:31.229 --> 01:18:34.982
What about ancient history,
like Emilio Rebenga?

01:18:35.066 --> 01:18:38.236
Or a bunch of whacked-out
Indians at the Sun Ray Motel?

01:18:39.821 --> 01:18:41.948
Whoever's giving you
your information

01:18:42.031 --> 01:18:43.741
is taking you
for a long ride.

01:18:44.075 --> 01:18:45.243
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

01:18:45.326 --> 01:18:47.703
Tony, baby,
we gonna talk,

01:18:47.787 --> 01:18:50.706
or am I gonna bust
your wiseass spic balls

01:18:50.790 --> 01:18:52.166
here and now?

01:18:58.047 --> 01:18:59.632
Keep your eye on her.

01:19:00.675 --> 01:19:02.218
- I'll do that.
- Okay.

01:19:03.970 --> 01:19:05.972
My office.
Good.

01:19:13.729 --> 01:19:17.358
The word on the street is you're
bringing in a lot of <i>yeyo.</i>

01:19:17.608 --> 01:19:20.111
That means you're not a
small-time punk anymore,

01:19:20.194 --> 01:19:22.071
you're public
property now.

01:19:22.155 --> 01:19:24.991
Supreme Court says that
your privacy can be invaded.

01:19:25.074 --> 01:19:26.826
Okay. How much?

01:19:28.369 --> 01:19:29.745
How much?

01:19:30.455 --> 01:19:32.915
There's an answer
to that, too.

01:19:39.505 --> 01:19:40.882
Here's how much.

01:19:42.133 --> 01:19:43.426
Can you see it?

01:19:45.470 --> 01:19:47.346
Big number.
Yeah!

01:19:47.513 --> 01:19:50.433
That's on a monthly basis,
same thing every month.

01:19:50.892 --> 01:19:52.602
You know
how this works?

01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:55.938
No. You tell me.

01:19:56.522 --> 01:19:58.941
We tell you who's
moving against you,

01:19:59.317 --> 01:20:02.111
and we shake down
who you want shaken down.

01:20:02.987 --> 01:20:06.324
Let's say that you got a real
problem making a collection.

01:20:07.700 --> 01:20:09.619
And then we step in
for you.

01:20:10.036 --> 01:20:12.371
Got eight killers with
badges working for me.

01:20:12.455 --> 01:20:13.748
When they hit, it hurts.

01:20:13.831 --> 01:20:15.541
Same thing
works the other way.

01:20:15.625 --> 01:20:17.710
You feed me
a bust now and then.

01:20:18.085 --> 01:20:21.339
Some cowboy setting
himself up in business.

01:20:22.006 --> 01:20:24.258
Small fry, you know?

01:20:28.054 --> 01:20:29.680
We like snacks.

01:20:29.931 --> 01:20:33.309
How do I know you're the last
cop I'm gonna have to grease?

01:20:34.018 --> 01:20:38.731
What about Fort Lauderdale?
Metro? DEA?

01:20:39.565 --> 01:20:42.485
How do I know what rock they're
gonna crawl out from under?

01:20:42.568 --> 01:20:45.404
Well, that's not
my business, Tony.

01:20:45.488 --> 01:20:46.781
We don't cross no lines.

01:20:48.115 --> 01:20:50.868
You think I want
this conversation

01:20:50.952 --> 01:20:52.745
going any farther
than this table?

01:20:53.204 --> 01:20:56.457
My guys' got families.
They're legitimate cops.

01:20:56.749 --> 01:20:58.751
I don't want to
see them embarrassed.

01:20:58.834 --> 01:21:00.711
If they're embarrassed,
they'll suffer.

01:21:00.795 --> 01:21:03.506
If they suffer,
they'll make you suffer.

01:21:06.092 --> 01:21:08.469
You understand
what I'm talking about?

01:21:09.011 --> 01:21:10.137
Huh?

01:21:19.146 --> 01:21:20.815
Thanks for the drink.

01:21:23.693 --> 01:21:25.152
By the way,

01:21:26.195 --> 01:21:28.197
I got a vacation
coming up.

01:21:28.406 --> 01:21:30.908
I'm gonna take the wife
to London, England.

01:21:30.992 --> 01:21:32.451
We've never been there.

01:21:32.535 --> 01:21:35.830
So throw in a couple of round-trip
tickets, first class.

01:21:42.712 --> 01:21:45.965
You gotta smile more, Tony.
You gotta enjoy yourself.

01:21:46.591 --> 01:21:49.010
Every day above ground
is a good day.

01:22:01.772 --> 01:22:02.773
Hello.

01:22:02.857 --> 01:22:03.858
Hello.

01:22:05.276 --> 01:22:07.361
Yeah.
Now that's the idea.

01:22:07.528 --> 01:22:09.238
Okay, Mel.

01:22:11.574 --> 01:22:13.534
You think about
what I said?

01:22:14.076 --> 01:22:15.369
About the kids?

01:22:16.746 --> 01:22:19.498
You know,
you are really nuts.

01:22:19.582 --> 01:22:21.250
I'm nuts about you.

01:22:22.084 --> 01:22:24.462
Why don't you
find your own girl?

01:22:24.712 --> 01:22:25.880
My own girl?
Yeah.

01:22:25.963 --> 01:22:27.089
That's what I'm doing.

01:22:27.173 --> 01:22:29.008
Go do it somewhere else.
Get lost.

01:22:29.091 --> 01:22:31.385
Maybe I don't hear
so good sometimes.

01:22:31.469 --> 01:22:33.763
You won't hear anything
if you go on like this.

01:22:33.888 --> 01:22:35.056
Will you do something?

01:22:35.139 --> 01:22:37.892
You're fucking right
I'm going to do something!

01:22:39.143 --> 01:22:41.103
I'm giving you orders.
Blow!

01:22:41.228 --> 01:22:44.899
Orders?
You giving me orders?

01:22:50.488 --> 01:22:52.823
The only thing
in this world

01:22:52.907 --> 01:22:56.577
that gives orders is balls.
You got that?

01:22:58.079 --> 01:22:59.288
Balls.

01:23:09.757 --> 01:23:10.925
Let's go.

01:23:18.766 --> 01:23:19.850
Elvira.

01:23:21.268 --> 01:23:24.105
When you
gonna learn? Huh?

01:23:25.773 --> 01:23:29.485
Looking good, honey.
Keep up the bad work.

01:23:31.278 --> 01:23:32.279
That cocksucker.

01:23:32.363 --> 01:23:33.406
What happened?

01:23:34.281 --> 01:23:36.951
He put that prick
Bernstein on me.

01:23:37.034 --> 01:23:38.119
Who? Lopez did?

01:23:39.620 --> 01:23:40.705
How do you know?

01:23:40.788 --> 01:23:43.290
Who else knew
about Rebenga? Omar?

01:23:43.874 --> 01:23:45.543
He's fertilizer.

01:23:46.043 --> 01:23:48.629
He's letting me know
he's got weight on me.

01:23:51.799 --> 01:23:53.426
I'll tell you what, man.

01:23:53.509 --> 01:23:56.470
You know our little trip we've
been planning to New York?

01:23:56.554 --> 01:23:58.305
It might be a good time.

01:24:15.364 --> 01:24:17.324
Wait.
Where you going?

01:24:43.100 --> 01:24:44.852
Welcome to
my private room.

01:24:44.935 --> 01:24:46.270
Your private room.

01:24:46.353 --> 01:24:47.646
This is my private room.

01:24:47.730 --> 01:24:51.400
I got a beautiful, nice,
white lounge chair for you.

01:24:56.530 --> 01:24:58.908
Gina, you taste
so <i>muy bueno.</i>

01:25:02.787 --> 01:25:03.788
Tony!

01:25:04.371 --> 01:25:06.248
What are you doing?
Shut up!

01:25:06.373 --> 01:25:08.626
What?
We wasn't doing nothing!

01:25:08.709 --> 01:25:10.044
Fernando, wait!

01:25:10.377 --> 01:25:11.712
Get out!

01:25:14.548 --> 01:25:15.883
Damn you!

01:25:15.966 --> 01:25:17.718
You think he's cute?

01:25:17.802 --> 01:25:20.262
I saw him putting his
hand all over your ass.

01:25:20.387 --> 01:25:22.223
My kid sister
in a toilet.

01:25:22.306 --> 01:25:23.557
It's none of
your business.

01:25:23.641 --> 01:25:26.060
None of my business?
The fuck it ain't!

01:25:26.143 --> 01:25:27.311
You can't tell me
what to do!

01:25:27.394 --> 01:25:28.479
I am telling you!

01:25:28.562 --> 01:25:30.564
Listen to me.
Come here.

01:25:31.607 --> 01:25:35.444
I catch you here again,

01:25:35.528 --> 01:25:37.154
I'm gonna wipe you all
over the fucking place.

01:25:37.238 --> 01:25:40.157
Yeah? Go ahead!
Do it now.
I want to see it.

01:25:40.241 --> 01:25:41.367
I want to see
it now, big shot.

01:25:41.450 --> 01:25:42.535
Don't push me.

01:25:42.618 --> 01:25:43.786
I want to see it now!

01:25:43.869 --> 01:25:46.163
Don't push me!
Get outta here!

01:25:46.413 --> 01:25:47.957
Go outside.

01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:50.000
You got some nerve, Tony!

01:25:50.584 --> 01:25:53.128
You think you can
tell me what to do?

01:25:53.254 --> 01:25:55.005
You can't
tell me what to do.

01:25:55.089 --> 01:25:56.215
I'm not a baby anymore.

01:25:56.298 --> 01:25:59.176
I'll do what I want to do,
see whoever I want to see.

01:25:59.260 --> 01:26:02.346
And if I want to fuck them,
then I'll fuck them!

01:26:03.973 --> 01:26:06.642
Fucking, man!
Come on, man.

01:26:10.813 --> 01:26:14.024
What the fuck you want?
You want something? Huh?

01:26:14.358 --> 01:26:16.610
No. Don't touch me.

01:26:18.779 --> 01:26:20.447
No.
We've got to get out of here.

01:26:20.531 --> 01:26:24.451
Not there.
I don't want to go out there.

01:26:25.411 --> 01:26:27.454
<i>Another great night here
at the Babylon, right?</i>

01:26:27.538 --> 01:26:29.498
<i>Okay. All right!</i>

01:26:29.790 --> 01:26:31.458
<i>Do another gram,
you'll all be babbling on.</i>

01:26:33.377 --> 01:26:36.171
<i>Is that coke in your bra,
or are you just glad to see me?</i>

01:26:36.297 --> 01:26:38.299
<i>A little bit of hope,
I'm sure, yes.</i>

01:26:38.382 --> 01:26:41.510
<i>I'm in a good mood.
I was depressed when
I got up this morning.</i>

01:26:41.635 --> 01:26:44.513
<i>I had a dry dream,
but I'm better now.</i>

01:26:59.820 --> 01:27:01.780
<i>I do Laurel and Hardy
in Spanish, too.</i>

01:27:04.742 --> 01:27:06.869
<i>That's the height of
culture, I assure you.</i>

01:27:06.994 --> 01:27:09.538
<i>But my favorite Cuban of all
time has to be Ricky Ricardo.</i>

01:27:10.706 --> 01:27:12.750
<i>Mr. Babalu himself.</i>

01:27:12.833 --> 01:27:14.668
<i>He had the same problem
for 10 years.</i>

01:27:14.752 --> 01:27:17.421
<i>"Lucy, don't come
down to the club."</i>

01:27:49.328 --> 01:27:52.456
He's your brother.
He loves you.
That's why he did it.

01:27:52.539 --> 01:27:54.625
All right?
He cares about you.

01:27:54.708 --> 01:27:57.294
To him, you're still
his little sister.

01:27:57.419 --> 01:28:00.839
That's the problem.
He still treats me like I'm a baby.

01:28:00.923 --> 01:28:02.466
I'm 20 years old now.

01:28:02.549 --> 01:28:03.968
I'm not anybody's baby.

01:28:04.051 --> 01:28:05.427
You're so grown-up.

01:28:08.222 --> 01:28:11.558
Come on, Gina.
Put yourself in his place, okay?

01:28:11.684 --> 01:28:15.312
Right now, you happen to be
the best thing in his life,

01:28:15.396 --> 01:28:19.316
the only thing that's any
good, that's pure.

01:28:20.234 --> 01:28:23.153
Of course he doesn't want
you mixing with those people,

01:28:23.237 --> 01:28:24.571
growing up
to be like him.

01:28:25.906 --> 01:28:27.658
He has this
father thing for you.

01:28:27.741 --> 01:28:29.243
Feels like
he has to protect you.

01:28:29.326 --> 01:28:31.078
Protect me against what?

01:28:31.370 --> 01:28:33.622
Against guys
like that asshole

01:28:33.706 --> 01:28:34.999
you were
dancing with tonight.

01:28:35.082 --> 01:28:39.169
I like Fernando.
He's a fun guy and he's nice.

01:28:40.754 --> 01:28:43.674
And he knows how
to treat a woman.
All right?

01:28:43.924 --> 01:28:45.759
He knows how to treat a woman?
Yes.

01:28:45.884 --> 01:28:47.928
By taking her to the
toilet to make out?

01:28:48.053 --> 01:28:50.180
<i>You've been a great audience.</i>

01:28:50.264 --> 01:28:52.099
<i>I got a special
treat for you.</i>

01:28:52.182 --> 01:28:53.767
<i>Here's a guy
I found in the jungle</i>

01:28:53.851 --> 01:28:54.977
<i>from Caracas, Venezuela.</i>

01:28:55.060 --> 01:28:56.687
<i>He's unlike
anything you've seen.</i>

01:28:56.770 --> 01:29:00.399
<i>Give a warm Babylon welcome
to the one and only Octavio!</i>

01:29:26.133 --> 01:29:28.218
Look around.
Go out with someone

01:29:28.302 --> 01:29:29.303
who has something
on the ball,

01:29:29.386 --> 01:29:30.888
who's going
somewhere in life.

01:29:30.971 --> 01:29:32.097
Like who?

01:29:32.806 --> 01:29:36.143
For instance,
someone who's got
a real job, like a banker.

01:29:36.268 --> 01:29:37.853
Or... Or a doctor,
a lawyer...

01:29:37.936 --> 01:29:39.146
What about you?

01:29:41.565 --> 01:29:43.108
What are you
talking about?

01:29:43.192 --> 01:29:44.735
Why don't you
take me out?

01:29:44.818 --> 01:29:46.737
Are you crazy?

01:29:46.820 --> 01:29:48.822
I see the way
you look at me, Manolo.

01:29:49.114 --> 01:29:50.616
Do you think I'm blind?
I see.

01:29:50.699 --> 01:29:51.950
Come on.

01:29:52.409 --> 01:29:54.328
What?
Look, Gina,

01:29:55.829 --> 01:29:58.499
Tony and I are
like brothers, all right?

01:29:58.832 --> 01:30:00.501
You're his kid sister.

01:30:00.584 --> 01:30:02.252
So what?
That's where it ends.

01:30:03.003 --> 01:30:04.171
That's where it stays.

01:30:04.254 --> 01:30:06.173
Are you afraid
of Tony, huh?

01:30:07.091 --> 01:30:08.425
You afraid of
Tony's kid sister?

01:30:08.509 --> 01:30:10.594
I'm not afraid
of anybody!

01:30:10.928 --> 01:30:12.846
That's not
the point here!

01:32:28.023 --> 01:32:29.608
Oh, fuck.

01:32:31.443 --> 01:32:33.403
It's not for me.
Don't look at me.

01:32:33.487 --> 01:32:35.239
How do you know?

01:32:35.322 --> 01:32:36.573
'Cause I'm not here.

01:32:36.657 --> 01:32:38.533
Oh, really?
Then where are you?

01:32:41.536 --> 01:32:43.080
Shit, you're weird.

01:32:43.163 --> 01:32:44.289
I'm weird?

01:32:44.373 --> 01:32:45.499
Hello?

01:32:45.582 --> 01:32:46.625
<i>Hello, Miriam?</i>

01:32:46.708 --> 01:32:48.001
Tony!

01:32:48.085 --> 01:32:49.920
<i>Put Manny on, okay?</i>

01:32:50.003 --> 01:32:51.338
Okay. Just a second.

01:32:51.672 --> 01:32:52.965
It's Tony.

01:32:55.968 --> 01:32:58.220
What are you doing,
checking up on me?

01:32:58.303 --> 01:33:00.138
Get your clothes on
and meet me

01:33:00.222 --> 01:33:02.140
in front of Lopez Motors
in 45 minutes.

01:33:02.933 --> 01:33:04.518
What? What happened?

01:33:04.601 --> 01:33:06.144
<i>Nothing we can't fix.</i>

01:33:06.770 --> 01:33:09.147
All right.
I'll be there.

01:33:09.231 --> 01:33:11.858
<i>You're still
on the phone. Let's go.</i>

01:33:11.942 --> 01:33:13.068
Take it easy, okay?

01:33:13.151 --> 01:33:16.029
I'm leaving now. Fuck.

01:33:16.613 --> 01:33:18.240
Nick?
Yeah, Tony.

01:33:18.323 --> 01:33:20.659
This is what I want you
to do for me,

01:33:22.077 --> 01:33:23.870
you call Lopez.

01:33:24.371 --> 01:33:28.041
Call him at his office
at 3:00 sharp.

01:33:28.959 --> 01:33:31.878
And you tell him,

01:33:33.005 --> 01:33:35.173
"We fucked up,
he got away."

01:33:35.841 --> 01:33:36.967
Okay. Yeah.

01:33:37.050 --> 01:33:38.385
Got it? What are you
going to say?

01:33:38.468 --> 01:33:40.387
"We fucked up.
He got away."

01:33:42.222 --> 01:33:43.890
What time?
3:00 sharp.

01:33:46.184 --> 01:33:48.895
So when are we gonna make
some money on this thing?

01:33:49.021 --> 01:33:51.982
Six months to start
don't mean shit, Larry.

01:33:52.566 --> 01:33:55.819
I'm not a Rockefeller, you know.
Not yet, anyway.

01:33:57.487 --> 01:33:59.197
So you owe me.

01:34:00.407 --> 01:34:02.909
Listen, go down
to the ball game tonight?

01:34:03.368 --> 01:34:04.995
I couldn't make it.
I got things.

01:34:05.078 --> 01:34:06.663
I'll tell you
about them.

01:34:07.581 --> 01:34:10.917
You're kidding.
What was the score?
Three to two?

01:34:12.252 --> 01:34:13.503
Mel, guess what.

01:34:13.587 --> 01:34:15.422
My Little League team,
the Little Lopezers,

01:34:15.547 --> 01:34:17.257
they won
the division tonight.

01:34:17.382 --> 01:34:19.718
That's great.
Congratulations.

01:34:20.093 --> 01:34:22.929
What'd you do,
fix the umpire?

01:34:25.849 --> 01:34:28.435
Jesus Christ.

01:34:30.354 --> 01:34:32.272
Tony, what happened
to you?

01:34:35.108 --> 01:34:38.070
They wanted to
spoil my $800 suit.

01:34:39.112 --> 01:34:41.239
Who the fuck
did this?

01:34:41.865 --> 01:34:44.534
Hitters. I don't know.

01:34:45.619 --> 01:34:47.788
Somebody must've
brought them in.

01:34:48.413 --> 01:34:50.248
I've never
seen them before.

01:34:50.624 --> 01:34:52.042
Hello, Mel.

01:34:53.418 --> 01:34:55.212
Got an answer
to this, too?

01:34:56.254 --> 01:34:57.589
There always is, Tony.

01:34:57.672 --> 01:34:59.633
I'll bet it was
the Diaz brothers.

01:34:59.758 --> 01:35:02.552
They got a beef going back
to the Sun Ray thing.

01:35:03.762 --> 01:35:07.766
Maybe you're right,
you know?

01:35:08.225 --> 01:35:12.771
Anyway, I'm glad
you made it, Tony.

01:35:13.814 --> 01:35:16.900
We'll return the favor
for you in spades.

01:35:16.983 --> 01:35:19.778
I'll take care
of this myself.

01:35:25.617 --> 01:35:27.494
What is the gun
for, Tony?

01:35:28.453 --> 01:35:31.164
What, this?
It's nothing.

01:35:32.833 --> 01:35:37.129
I'm...
How do you say? Paranoid.

01:35:51.518 --> 01:35:53.353
You gonna answer, Frank?

01:35:55.522 --> 01:35:59.192
It must be Elvira.
She got mad after we left the club.

01:36:02.362 --> 01:36:04.281
I'll tell her
you're not here, okay?

01:36:04.364 --> 01:36:08.201
No, it's all right.
I'll talk to her.

01:36:16.168 --> 01:36:17.377
Hello.

01:36:24.176 --> 01:36:27.637
It's all right. I'm gonna be
home in an hour. Don't worry.

01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:33.852
Frank,
you're a piece of shit.

01:36:33.977 --> 01:36:36.188
What are you
talking about?

01:36:36.271 --> 01:36:37.606
You know what
I'm talking about,

01:36:37.689 --> 01:36:40.192
you fucking cockroach.

01:36:40.317 --> 01:36:43.236
What are you talking about?
Listen to me, huh.

01:36:43.361 --> 01:36:45.572
You know what
a <i>chazer</i> is, Frank?

01:36:46.573 --> 01:36:49.576
That's a pig
that don't fly straight.

01:36:50.702 --> 01:36:52.287
Neither do you, Frank.

01:36:53.872 --> 01:36:56.708
Tony, why the fuck
would I hurt you?

01:36:57.083 --> 01:36:58.752
I brought you in.

01:36:58.877 --> 01:37:01.421
So we had a few
differences, no big deal.

01:37:02.756 --> 01:37:05.675
I gave you your start.
I was the one who believed in you.

01:37:05.759 --> 01:37:07.928
I stayed loyal to you.

01:37:10.222 --> 01:37:11.932
I made what I could
on the side,

01:37:12.015 --> 01:37:13.725
but I never
turned on you, Frank!

01:37:14.392 --> 01:37:15.435
Never!

01:37:19.147 --> 01:37:20.398
But you,

01:37:23.944 --> 01:37:28.448
a man who ain't got his
word is a cockroach.

01:37:32.077 --> 01:37:34.788
Mel. Do something,
will you?

01:37:39.125 --> 01:37:41.795
It's your tree, Frank.
You're sitting in it.

01:37:49.636 --> 01:37:52.806
All right, Tony.
I was the one.

01:37:59.604 --> 01:38:01.982
Please, give me
a second chance.

01:38:03.817 --> 01:38:06.653
Will you do that?
Please?

01:38:11.491 --> 01:38:15.245
Give me a second chance.
I'll give you $10 million.

01:38:15.662 --> 01:38:19.040
Okay? $10 million.

01:38:19.666 --> 01:38:22.877
I got it in a vault
over there in Spain, Tony.

01:38:23.003 --> 01:38:27.549
We go over there,
we get on a plane,
and it's yours.

01:38:28.216 --> 01:38:31.553
Okay? All of it.
$10 million.

01:38:32.470 --> 01:38:33.638
Okay, Tony?

01:38:35.515 --> 01:38:36.725
Huh?

01:38:37.726 --> 01:38:39.060
Please, Tony?

01:38:40.854 --> 01:38:44.065
Elvira?
You want Elvira?

01:38:44.858 --> 01:38:47.902
You can have her.
I'll go away.
I'm gonna disappear.

01:38:48.028 --> 01:38:49.863
You'll never
see me again.

01:38:49.946 --> 01:38:51.573
Please, Tony,
I don't want to die.

01:38:51.698 --> 01:38:53.658
I never did
nothing to nobody.

01:38:53.825 --> 01:38:56.703
No, you never did
nothing to nobody.

01:38:56.995 --> 01:38:58.913
You had somebody
else do it for you.

01:38:59.039 --> 01:39:00.332
Oh, Tony,
I'm begging you.

01:39:00.415 --> 01:39:02.042
Get up! Get up now!

01:39:02.125 --> 01:39:04.210
Jesus!
No! God!

01:39:09.215 --> 01:39:12.886
Look. Tony, no!
Don't kill me, please.

01:39:15.847 --> 01:39:17.265
I won't kill you.

01:39:17.932 --> 01:39:19.934
Oh, Christ, thank you.
Get off my foot.

01:39:20.060 --> 01:39:21.519
Thank you.

01:39:21.603 --> 01:39:23.730
Manolo, shoot that
piece of shit!

01:39:23.980 --> 01:39:25.398
No, no!

01:39:25.732 --> 01:39:27.150
No!

01:39:45.710 --> 01:39:48.588
Every dog has
his day, huh, Mel?

01:39:48.713 --> 01:39:49.923
I told him

01:39:51.424 --> 01:39:53.301
it didn't make any sense

01:39:53.426 --> 01:39:57.263
clipping you when
we had you working for us.
He wouldn't listen.

01:39:58.056 --> 01:40:01.893
He got hot tonight
about the broad.

01:40:03.978 --> 01:40:05.438
He fucked up.

01:40:06.231 --> 01:40:09.943
You, too, Mel.
You fucked up.

01:40:11.152 --> 01:40:12.821
Don't go too far, Tony.

01:40:14.447 --> 01:40:17.200
I'm not, Mel. You are.

01:40:26.042 --> 01:40:28.962
Fuck. You can't
shoot a cop!

01:40:30.505 --> 01:40:32.048
Whoever says
you was one?

01:40:32.132 --> 01:40:33.675
Wait a minute!

01:40:35.802 --> 01:40:37.971
You let me go.
I'll fix this up.

01:40:38.471 --> 01:40:42.559
Sure, Mel.
Maybe you can
handle yourself

01:40:42.976 --> 01:40:46.312
one of them first-class
tickets to the Resurrection.

01:40:46.813 --> 01:40:50.483
Fucking punk!
Son of a bitch!

01:40:52.235 --> 01:40:53.903
So long, Mel.
Have a good trip.

01:40:53.987 --> 01:40:55.029
Fuck you!

01:41:01.828 --> 01:41:03.413
Okay, come on.

01:41:03.496 --> 01:41:05.039
What about Ernie?

01:41:15.175 --> 01:41:16.843
You want a job, Ernie?

01:41:20.388 --> 01:41:21.681
Sure, Tony.

01:41:21.765 --> 01:41:23.558
Okay, then you
call me tomorrow.

01:41:24.267 --> 01:41:26.102
Man, you got a job!

01:41:27.020 --> 01:41:29.856
Tony! Thanks.

01:41:59.803 --> 01:42:00.887
Tony.

01:42:05.099 --> 01:42:06.935
God, what's happened?

01:42:09.229 --> 01:42:10.605
Where's Frank?

01:42:12.398 --> 01:42:14.108
Where do you think?

01:42:19.405 --> 01:42:22.909
Come on.
Get your stuff.

01:42:23.409 --> 01:42:24.953
You're coming with me.

01:47:02.021 --> 01:47:05.483
So you come to me with
some kind of thing.
Okay.

01:47:05.566 --> 01:47:07.568
You propose it,
I talk to you.

01:47:08.027 --> 01:47:11.322
But we got a problem.
I can't pay more.

01:47:12.448 --> 01:47:15.451
I'm bringing in twice as
much as I ever did before.

01:47:15.660 --> 01:47:19.038
We're doing 10 million,
15 million a month.
Come on.

01:47:19.205 --> 01:47:21.249
That's serious money.

01:47:21.541 --> 01:47:23.334
You bank boys
gotta come down a bit.

01:47:23.417 --> 01:47:24.460
No way.

01:47:24.544 --> 01:47:26.796
That's crazy.
We can't do that.

01:47:26.879 --> 01:47:28.339
Then that's too bad.

01:47:28.631 --> 01:47:30.591
What am I gonna do?

01:47:30.675 --> 01:47:31.926
We're not
a wholesale operation.

01:47:32.009 --> 01:47:35.680
We're a legitimate bank.
The more cash you give me,

01:47:35.763 --> 01:47:38.015
the harder it is
for me to rinse.

01:47:38.516 --> 01:47:40.393
That's a problem.
I didn't know.

01:47:40.476 --> 01:47:43.396
The fact is,
I can't take any more
of your money

01:47:43.479 --> 01:47:45.815
unless I raise
the rates on you.

01:47:47.441 --> 01:47:49.277
You gonna raise the...
I gotta do it.

01:47:49.360 --> 01:47:50.528
The IRS is coming...

01:47:50.611 --> 01:47:53.281
Don't give me that shit!
Let's talk.

01:47:53.364 --> 01:47:54.407
I'm talking.

01:47:54.490 --> 01:47:56.993
I go low, you go high.
I know the game.

01:47:57.076 --> 01:47:58.244
This is business talk.

01:47:58.327 --> 01:47:59.620
Let me explain
something.

01:47:59.704 --> 01:48:02.165
The IRS is coming down
heavy on South Florida.

01:48:02.248 --> 01:48:04.667
There was a <i>TIME</i> magazine
story that didn't help.

01:48:04.750 --> 01:48:06.210
There's a recession.

01:48:06.294 --> 01:48:08.629
I got stockholders I got
to be responsible for.

01:48:08.713 --> 01:48:09.839
I got to do it, Tony.

01:48:09.922 --> 01:48:11.132
You'll learn from him.

01:48:11.215 --> 01:48:14.594
I got to go 10% on the first 12
million in denominations of 20.

01:48:14.677 --> 01:48:16.679
I'll go 8%
on your $10 bills,

01:48:16.762 --> 01:48:17.805
6% on your fives.

01:48:17.889 --> 01:48:19.682
We'll go somewhere else.
That's it.

01:48:19.765 --> 01:48:21.934
There's no place
else to go.

01:48:22.018 --> 01:48:23.311
Fuck you, man!
Fuck you!

01:48:23.394 --> 01:48:26.397
I'll fly the cash myself
to the Bahamas.

01:48:26.731 --> 01:48:29.275
Once, maybe.
Then what?

01:48:29.901 --> 01:48:32.195
You'll trust some monkey
in a Bahamian bank

01:48:32.278 --> 01:48:34.363
with 20 million of
your hard-earned dollars?

01:48:34.447 --> 01:48:36.282
Come on, Tony.
Don't be a schmuck.

01:48:36.657 --> 01:48:37.950
Who else can you trust?

01:48:38.034 --> 01:48:40.828
That's why you pay us so much.
You trust us.

01:48:41.621 --> 01:48:42.747
Huh?

01:48:45.625 --> 01:48:47.376
Did you hear that guy?

01:48:47.752 --> 01:48:50.421
You got to listen to him.
You'll learn something.

01:48:50.504 --> 01:48:51.714
Stay with us.

01:48:51.797 --> 01:48:54.884
You're a well-liked customer.
You're in good hands with us.

01:48:57.303 --> 01:48:58.471
And I got to run.

01:48:58.554 --> 01:48:59.680
I'm safe but poor.

01:49:01.098 --> 01:49:03.059
How's married life
treating you?

01:49:03.142 --> 01:49:04.227
Better than you are.

01:49:05.770 --> 01:49:08.940
Say hello to the princess for me.
She's beautiful.

01:49:09.023 --> 01:49:11.567
I'll see you.
Take care.

01:49:11.651 --> 01:49:12.735
You, too.

01:49:26.123 --> 01:49:27.583
That prick!

01:49:29.210 --> 01:49:30.836
Fucking WASP whore.

01:49:31.879 --> 01:49:35.091
Talking to me like I'm some <i>maricÃ³n</i>
who came over on a boat.

01:49:36.759 --> 01:49:40.096
I tell you what.
We don't need that
smiling motherfucker.

01:49:40.179 --> 01:49:43.683
We should talk to this Jewish guy,
Seidelbaum, okay?

01:49:44.016 --> 01:49:47.979
He's got his own exchange.
He charges 4% at the most.

01:49:48.688 --> 01:49:50.231
And he's connected.

01:49:51.440 --> 01:49:55.695
Fuck them.
Mob guys. Guineas.

01:49:56.946 --> 01:49:58.489
I don't trust them.

01:50:17.800 --> 01:50:20.636
Did you sweep the house this month?
The cars?

01:50:21.095 --> 01:50:24.724
Yeah, I told you about it.
The $5,000?

01:50:25.891 --> 01:50:27.476
Look at that.

01:50:27.560 --> 01:50:28.728
What?

01:50:29.312 --> 01:50:30.938
That cable truck there.

01:50:31.022 --> 01:50:33.941
Since when does it take
three days to rig a cable?

01:50:36.235 --> 01:50:38.821
What?
You been watching it
for three days?

01:50:40.781 --> 01:50:43.034
The thing has been there
for three days.

01:50:43.117 --> 01:50:44.910
What am I gonna do,
not look at it?

01:50:45.494 --> 01:50:47.163
What, you think
it's cops, right?

01:50:47.246 --> 01:50:48.372
I don't know.

01:50:48.581 --> 01:50:51.876
Could be the Diaz
brothers, coming to get me.

01:50:53.711 --> 01:50:56.630
Maybe.
I'll check it out, okay?

01:50:56.714 --> 01:50:57.798
You check it out.

01:50:57.882 --> 01:51:01.385
Then we're gonna blow that
fucking truck back to Colombia!

01:51:01.677 --> 01:51:06.015
Come on.
We're not the only dopers
living on the block.

01:51:06.098 --> 01:51:07.433
Okay? Remember that.

01:51:07.516 --> 01:51:10.519
That truck could be
anybody and anything.

01:51:10.603 --> 01:51:11.979
It could be
a cable company...

01:51:12.063 --> 01:51:14.398
You know something?
You got some fucking attitude.

01:51:14.482 --> 01:51:17.151
For someone who's in
charge of my security...

01:51:17.568 --> 01:51:20.613
Here are the keys
to the front door.

01:51:20.696 --> 01:51:22.573
Go down there.
Give them the keys!

01:51:22.656 --> 01:51:24.367
I'm just trying
to say something.

01:51:24.450 --> 01:51:27.495
You're spending a lot of money
on this counter-surveillance.

01:51:27.578 --> 01:51:28.704
I don't give a fuck.

01:51:28.788 --> 01:51:31.415
It's 12% of our
adjusted gross.

01:51:31.499 --> 01:51:32.708
12% isn't peanuts.

01:51:32.792 --> 01:51:33.959
I don't give a fuck!

01:51:34.043 --> 01:51:36.504
It makes me sleep good at night.
That's what counts.

01:51:36.587 --> 01:51:37.838
Okay?
You worry about it.

01:51:37.922 --> 01:51:38.964
I am worried about it.

01:51:39.048 --> 01:51:41.801
I'm telling you.
We're getting sloppy.

01:51:42.301 --> 01:51:45.888
Our thinking,
our fucking attitude,
you know?

01:51:46.097 --> 01:51:47.890
We're not
fucking hungry anymore.

01:51:48.474 --> 01:51:50.601
<i>Miami's changing.
You can see it everywhere.</i>

01:51:50.684 --> 01:51:52.603
<i>New construction.
New jobs.</i>

01:51:52.812 --> 01:51:55.648
<i>Growth that's financed
by Florida Security Trust.</i>

01:51:55.731 --> 01:51:58.359
<i>We've put your money
to work for 75 years,</i>

01:51:58.442 --> 01:52:00.486
<i>building a more
prosperous Miami.</i>

01:52:00.903 --> 01:52:02.947
<i>Count on us
being here tomorrow.</i>

01:52:03.030 --> 01:52:06.200
That's because for 75 years,
you been fucking everybody.

01:52:06.492 --> 01:52:10.162
Somebody should do something
about those whores.

01:52:10.496 --> 01:52:13.082
I mean, charging me
10 points on my money.

01:52:13.165 --> 01:52:15.459
They're getting
away with it.

01:52:15.543 --> 01:52:16.961
Fuck, there's no
laws anymore.

01:52:17.044 --> 01:52:18.504
Forget it.
Anything goes.

01:52:18.587 --> 01:52:20.464
They been around
1,000 years.

01:52:20.548 --> 01:52:22.675
They got all
the angles figured out.

01:52:23.175 --> 01:52:26.178
You know what capitalism is?
Getting fucked.

01:52:26.303 --> 01:52:28.431
True capitalist
if ever I met one.

01:52:29.140 --> 01:52:30.224
Uh-oh.

01:52:30.307 --> 01:52:32.059
Did you hear that?

01:52:33.352 --> 01:52:35.354
How would you know,
bubblehead?

01:52:36.063 --> 01:52:38.649
You ever do nothing
besides get your hair fixed

01:52:38.732 --> 01:52:39.984
and powder your nose?

01:52:40.151 --> 01:52:42.695
Look at you.
You do too much of that shit.

01:52:42.778 --> 01:52:44.905
Nothing exceeds
like excess.

01:52:45.364 --> 01:52:47.783
You should
know that, Tony.

01:52:47.867 --> 01:52:48.909
I should know what?

01:52:50.161 --> 01:52:51.662
What should I know?

01:52:51.787 --> 01:52:54.415
Why do you have to talk to
me like that all the time,

01:52:54.498 --> 01:52:55.958
like I got to
know something?

01:52:56.041 --> 01:52:57.418
Let me talk to you.

01:52:57.710 --> 01:52:59.044
Listen.
What time is it?

01:52:59.128 --> 01:53:00.421
This Seidelbaum...

01:53:00.796 --> 01:53:02.047
6:55.

01:53:02.214 --> 01:53:03.299
Okay.

01:53:03.382 --> 01:53:04.592
I met with this
guy Seidelbaum...

01:53:04.675 --> 01:53:08.137
<i>The drug-related violence
that's plagued South Florida...</i>

01:53:08.596 --> 01:53:10.890
He's good for a laugh,
this guy.

01:53:10.973 --> 01:53:15.186
<i>With a small law-enforcement
budget, how can you put a dent</i>

01:53:15.269 --> 01:53:19.857
<i>on an estimated
$100-billion-a-year business?</i>

01:53:20.566 --> 01:53:22.443
<i>It seems at times
all you can do</i>

01:53:22.526 --> 01:53:24.570
<i>is put your finger
in the dike and pray.</i>

01:53:24.653 --> 01:53:26.489
Put your fingers
in a dyke?

01:53:26.822 --> 01:53:29.074
The only place
you can get your fingers

01:53:29.158 --> 01:53:30.534
is in some dyke.

01:53:31.368 --> 01:53:33.579
<i>...not by outlawing
the substances,</i>

01:53:33.704 --> 01:53:36.165
<i>but by legalizing
and taxing them.</i>

01:53:36.499 --> 01:53:41.629
<i>These voices say that will drive
out the organized crime element.</i>

01:53:42.296 --> 01:53:44.465
<i>I am not one
of those voices.</i>

01:53:44.548 --> 01:53:46.258
I know that.
But you know why?

01:53:46.342 --> 01:53:49.178
'Cause you got your head
up your <i>culo,</i> that's why.

01:53:49.261 --> 01:53:51.597
That fucking guy,
he never tells the truth.

01:53:51.680 --> 01:53:54.767
<i>...splendor of our city
at its best.</i>

01:53:55.059 --> 01:53:56.727
It's those guys, man!

01:53:56.810 --> 01:53:58.979
It's the fucking bankers,
the politicians,

01:53:59.063 --> 01:54:01.315
they're the ones that
wanna make coke illegal

01:54:01.398 --> 01:54:03.067
so they can make
the fucking money

01:54:03.150 --> 01:54:04.818
and then get
the fucking votes!

01:54:04.902 --> 01:54:08.113
They fighting the bad guys.
They're the bad guys!

01:54:08.405 --> 01:54:10.282
They fuck anything
and anyone.

01:54:10.366 --> 01:54:13.452
Can't you stop saying
"fuck" all the time?

01:54:13.619 --> 01:54:16.288
Can't you stop
talking about money?
It's boring, Tony.

01:54:16.372 --> 01:54:20.417
Where's this coming from?
Boring? What's boring?

01:54:20.543 --> 01:54:22.127
You're boring.
Oh.

01:54:22.586 --> 01:54:25.839
"Money."
That's all I hear in this house.

01:54:26.090 --> 01:54:29.093
Look at these pelicans fly.
Come on, pelicans!

01:54:29.176 --> 01:54:30.219
Here it is.

01:54:30.302 --> 01:54:31.845
Frank never
talked about money.

01:54:36.225 --> 01:54:38.686
That's 'cause
he was so smart.

01:54:45.943 --> 01:54:47.611
You know what
you're becoming?

01:54:47.695 --> 01:54:51.115
You're an immigrant spic millionaire
who can't stop talking...

01:54:51.198 --> 01:54:54.577
Who the fuck you calling a "spic,"
you white piece of bread?

01:54:54.660 --> 01:54:56.161
Get out of the way
of the TV!

01:54:56.245 --> 01:54:58.998
Dig a hole in the garden,
bury it, and forget about it.

01:54:59.248 --> 01:55:02.501
I work hard for this!
I want you to know that.

01:55:06.422 --> 01:55:08.799
Somebody should've
given it to you.

01:55:08.882 --> 01:55:10.342
You would've
been a nicer person.

01:55:12.469 --> 01:55:14.513
Know what your
problem is, pussycat?

01:55:14.597 --> 01:55:16.181
What is my problem?

01:55:16.932 --> 01:55:19.435
You got nothing to do
with your life.

01:55:20.561 --> 01:55:23.314
Why don't you get
a job or something?

01:55:23.814 --> 01:55:25.733
Do something.
Be a nurse.

01:55:26.567 --> 01:55:29.445
Work with blind kids, lepers.
That kind of thing.

01:55:30.863 --> 01:55:33.032
Anything beats
lying around all day

01:55:33.115 --> 01:55:34.617
waiting for me
to fuck you!

01:55:35.242 --> 01:55:37.745
Don't toot your horn, honey.
You're not that good.

01:55:37.828 --> 01:55:39.955
No? Frank was better?

01:55:41.248 --> 01:55:42.750
You're an asshole!

01:55:43.626 --> 01:55:45.586
Where you going?
Come here!

01:55:46.253 --> 01:55:48.505
Elvie!

01:55:49.214 --> 01:55:50.549
I was kidding!

01:55:52.051 --> 01:55:53.594
I was only kidding!

01:55:53.677 --> 01:55:55.971
I guess
sometimes married life

01:55:56.055 --> 01:55:57.931
is not all
it's cracked up to be.

01:55:58.140 --> 01:55:59.600
Where you going?

01:55:59.683 --> 01:56:00.684
I got a date.

01:56:01.560 --> 01:56:03.187
You got a date?
Come here.
Yeah.

01:56:08.317 --> 01:56:10.402
What?

01:56:10.486 --> 01:56:11.528
This Seidelbaum thing.

01:56:12.237 --> 01:56:13.822
Yeah, it's all set up.

01:56:14.281 --> 01:56:16.200
Yeah, well,
you forget it.

01:56:16.283 --> 01:56:18.285
Stay out of it.
I'll take care of it.

01:56:18.369 --> 01:56:21.121
Stay out of it?
It's my deal.
I set it up.

01:56:21.413 --> 01:56:23.791
You're not a negotiator,
Manny, you know that.

01:56:23.874 --> 01:56:26.293
You like the ladies
more than the money.

01:56:26.377 --> 01:56:27.419
That's your problem.

01:56:27.503 --> 01:56:30.422
What the fuck are you talking about?
I'm your partner, okay?

01:56:30.506 --> 01:56:32.925
If you don't trust me
with that kind of thing,

01:56:33.008 --> 01:56:34.551
who're you gonna trust?

01:56:34.635 --> 01:56:35.886
Junior partner.

01:56:37.346 --> 01:56:38.430
Bullshit, man.

01:56:38.514 --> 01:56:40.891
Don't talk to me about
trust, I don't like it.

01:56:41.600 --> 01:56:44.061
You should listen to your wife.
She's right.

01:56:44.144 --> 01:56:45.854
You are an asshole, man!

01:56:46.814 --> 01:56:49.149
Come here.
Give me a kiss.
Come here.

01:56:50.359 --> 01:56:51.819
Fuck you, man!

01:56:52.903 --> 01:56:56.407
Who put this thing together?
Me! That's who!

01:56:57.574 --> 01:56:59.785
Who do I trust? Me!

01:57:00.411 --> 01:57:02.454
Fuck him. "Trust."

01:57:05.249 --> 01:57:08.335
Asshole.
Fuck called me an asshole.

01:57:09.253 --> 01:57:10.629
I need that shit.

01:57:12.297 --> 01:57:13.799
I don't need him.

01:57:14.800 --> 01:57:18.637
I don't need her.
Fuck them.
I don't need nobody.

01:57:20.139 --> 01:57:22.349
Back then I worked in
pictures down in Colombia.

01:57:22.433 --> 01:57:25.185
I was in that movie <i>Burn.</i>
You ever see it?

01:57:25.602 --> 01:57:27.855
You saw me with
Marlon Brando?

01:57:27.938 --> 01:57:29.022
You know,
we're good friends.

01:57:29.148 --> 01:57:30.315
I was his driver.

01:57:30.399 --> 01:57:31.525
No shit?

01:57:31.650 --> 01:57:32.735
Brando.

01:57:32.818 --> 01:57:35.696
They shot it there.
Cartagena.

01:57:36.155 --> 01:57:37.990
Gillo Pontecorvo.
He was the director.

01:57:38.115 --> 01:57:39.199
Italian guy.

01:57:39.324 --> 01:57:41.118
Tell me about him.

01:57:41.201 --> 01:57:42.995
I also know
Paul Newman.

01:57:43.454 --> 01:57:44.455
I worked with him
in Tucson.

01:57:44.538 --> 01:57:45.539
No kidding?

01:57:45.664 --> 01:57:48.500
Do you know
Benny Alvarez?

01:57:48.584 --> 01:57:50.544
In Tucson.
Benny Alvarez?

01:57:50.627 --> 01:57:51.920
Subtotal.

01:57:52.004 --> 01:57:53.338
No?

01:57:56.008 --> 01:57:57.468
He's a nice guy.

01:57:58.010 --> 01:58:02.014
$283,107.65.

01:58:04.850 --> 01:58:06.852
You want
a company check here?

01:58:08.312 --> 01:58:12.232
I got 284.6.

01:58:12.357 --> 01:58:14.193
That's just
not possible.

01:58:14.276 --> 01:58:15.819
The machine
don't make mistakes.

01:58:19.364 --> 01:58:20.449
Let's count it again.

01:58:20.532 --> 01:58:21.533
No. Come on.

01:58:21.658 --> 01:58:23.452
Business is business.
Come on.

01:58:23.535 --> 01:58:25.037
You're talking
$1,500 here.

01:58:26.079 --> 01:58:29.208
Okay, you keep the change.
Okay? I don't give a shit.

01:58:31.001 --> 01:58:32.002
I'll count it
again for you.

01:58:32.085 --> 01:58:33.253
No, come on.

01:58:33.378 --> 01:58:36.173
This check here,
where does this check go?

01:58:39.551 --> 01:58:40.969
Montana Realty Company.

01:58:41.053 --> 01:58:42.054
Montana what?

01:58:42.513 --> 01:58:44.181
Montana Realty Company.

01:58:44.264 --> 01:58:48.018
Montana Realty Company.

01:58:48.227 --> 01:58:49.853
That's 284.

01:58:49.937 --> 01:58:51.897
284,600.

01:58:52.856 --> 01:58:55.359
How come you don't
know Benny Alvarez?

01:58:55.442 --> 01:58:57.653
Me and Benny
have lunch together.

01:58:57.736 --> 01:58:59.905
He probably knows me.

01:59:00.447 --> 01:59:02.032
You ask him.

01:59:20.050 --> 01:59:21.593
We're up to what?

01:59:23.136 --> 01:59:29.268
Seven checks.
$1,325,623.

01:59:32.062 --> 01:59:34.106
200,000 more.

01:59:34.231 --> 01:59:35.315
We ought to take a leak.

01:59:35.399 --> 01:59:36.400
Freeze!

01:59:36.483 --> 01:59:37.818
Get your hands up!

01:59:37.943 --> 01:59:39.486
Go against the wall,
turn around.

01:59:39.611 --> 01:59:40.612
You're not kidding.

01:59:40.737 --> 01:59:43.907
You're under arrest for
violation of the RICO Statute.

01:59:43.991 --> 01:59:45.659
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:59:45.784 --> 01:59:48.328
Anything you say can and
will be taken against you.

01:59:48.453 --> 01:59:50.163
How do I know
you guys are cops?

01:59:50.247 --> 01:59:51.915
What's that say, asshole?

01:59:53.333 --> 01:59:56.336
That's pretty good, man.
Where'd you get that?

01:59:56.461 --> 01:59:57.880
You call yourself
a Cuban?

01:59:57.963 --> 01:59:59.798
You make a real
Cuban throw up!

01:59:59.923 --> 02:00:02.092
Call your dog
off me, Seidelbaum.

02:00:02.467 --> 02:00:03.802
I want to call
my lawyer.

02:00:03.886 --> 02:00:05.637
Lot of good he's gonna do you.

02:00:05.804 --> 02:00:08.015
You see that eye
there in the clock?

02:00:08.348 --> 02:00:10.309
Say, "Hi, honey."

02:00:11.351 --> 02:00:13.395
<i>That's pretty cute.
Look at that.</i>

02:00:13.478 --> 02:00:15.689
<i>You jerk off in front of
us, Seidelbaum?</i>

02:00:15.814 --> 02:00:18.108
<i>I was supposed to
meet this chick at 3:00.</i>

02:00:18.191 --> 02:00:20.027
<i>You're a fucking
pain in the ass.</i>

02:00:20.360 --> 02:00:22.154
<i>All right, Benny,
kill it.</i>

02:00:23.155 --> 02:00:25.699
You understand the rights
I've given you?

02:00:25.866 --> 02:00:28.035
I know all that
bullshit, Seidelbaum!

02:00:28.160 --> 02:00:29.494
Save your breath.

02:00:29.828 --> 02:00:32.539
You got nothing on me.
You know it. I know it.

02:00:33.040 --> 02:00:35.375
I'm changing dollar bills,
that's all.

02:00:35.751 --> 02:00:39.171
You want to waste my time?
Okay. I call my lawyer.

02:00:39.838 --> 02:00:43.717
He's the best lawyer in Miami.
He's such a good lawyer

02:00:44.259 --> 02:00:48.096
that by tomorrow morning,
you gonna be working in Alaska.

02:00:49.848 --> 02:00:51.183
So dress warm.

02:00:55.228 --> 02:00:59.316
<i>Give me a check for 100
grand, plus 300 in cash.</i>

02:00:59.858 --> 02:01:02.611
I guarantee you walk
on the conspiracy charge.

02:01:03.528 --> 02:01:06.531
They're gonna come back
at us on a tax evasion,

02:01:07.616 --> 02:01:09.409
and they'll get it.

02:01:13.372 --> 02:01:15.707
So, what am I
looking at here?

02:01:17.960 --> 02:01:20.170
Five years.
You'll be out in three.

02:01:20.253 --> 02:01:22.923
Maybe less,
if I can make a deal.

02:01:24.549 --> 02:01:26.093
Three fucking years!

02:01:28.470 --> 02:01:29.763
For what?

02:01:30.806 --> 02:01:32.683
Washing money?

02:01:32.766 --> 02:01:34.309
The fucking country was
built on washed money.

02:01:34.393 --> 02:01:35.769
Can't be that bad.

02:01:35.894 --> 02:01:36.979
It's not like Cuba.

02:01:37.062 --> 02:01:38.313
What the fuck
you talking?

02:01:38.397 --> 02:01:40.148
The jails
are like hotels.

02:01:40.232 --> 02:01:41.608
You kidding me or what?

02:01:41.733 --> 02:01:43.151
You fucking high or what?

02:01:43.235 --> 02:01:44.569
I'll delay the trial.

02:01:44.778 --> 02:01:47.864
A year and a half, two years.
You won't even start...

02:01:47.948 --> 02:01:49.116
Fuck you, man!

02:01:49.241 --> 02:01:51.201
I'm not going back
in any cage, okay?

02:01:51.284 --> 02:01:53.120
No way. I been there.

02:01:58.750 --> 02:02:00.127
Okay, look.

02:02:02.421 --> 02:02:06.675
I give you $400,000 more.
Okay, now that's $800,000.

02:02:07.134 --> 02:02:10.303
With that kind of money,
you can buy the Supreme Court.

02:02:12.931 --> 02:02:16.435
Tony, the law has to prove
beyond a reasonable doubt.

02:02:17.352 --> 02:02:19.771
I'm an expert at
raising that doubt.

02:02:19.855 --> 02:02:21.523
But when you got
1.3 million

02:02:21.648 --> 02:02:24.860
undeclared staring into
a videotape camera,

02:02:25.527 --> 02:02:27.863
honey baby, it's hard
to convince a jury

02:02:27.946 --> 02:02:29.531
you found it
in a taxicab.

02:02:53.138 --> 02:02:55.682
I'm so glad you could
come on such short notice.

02:02:55.807 --> 02:02:56.892
I really appreciate it.

02:02:56.975 --> 02:02:58.685
It's okay.
How's Elvira?

02:02:58.977 --> 02:03:00.896
Oh, great.
How's your wife?

02:03:00.979 --> 02:03:02.064
Three more months.

02:03:02.230 --> 02:03:03.398
Oh, yeah?
Congratulations.

02:03:03.482 --> 02:03:04.649
How about you?

02:03:04.733 --> 02:03:07.444
When you gonna have another
Tony to take your place?

02:03:07.527 --> 02:03:08.612
I'm working on it.

02:03:08.695 --> 02:03:10.530
You have to
work harder. Come.

02:03:10.697 --> 02:03:13.075
I want you to meet
some of my friends.

02:03:17.996 --> 02:03:19.289
This is Pedro Quinn,

02:03:19.372 --> 02:03:21.374
chairman of the Andes
Sugar Corporation.

02:03:21.500 --> 02:03:22.793
Pleasure meeting you.

02:03:22.876 --> 02:03:23.960
Nice to meet you.

02:03:24.044 --> 02:03:27.422
General Edward Strasser,
Commander of the First Army Corps.

02:03:28.924 --> 02:03:30.133
Pleasure.

02:03:30.217 --> 02:03:32.260
This is Ariel Bleyer,

02:03:32.385 --> 02:03:35.347
with the Ministry of the Interior.
Tony Montana.

02:03:37.516 --> 02:03:41.436
And here is our friend Charles
Goodson from Washington.

02:03:41.728 --> 02:03:42.771
Nice to meet you.

02:03:42.854 --> 02:03:44.356
How do you do,
Mr. Montana?

02:03:45.398 --> 02:03:46.900
Sit here, Tony.

02:03:50.695 --> 02:03:51.947
Gentlemen.

02:03:55.867 --> 02:03:57.786
I would like to
discuss something

02:03:57.869 --> 02:03:59.871
that is of interest
to all of us here.

02:04:01.206 --> 02:04:02.916
You have a problem, Tony.

02:04:03.750 --> 02:04:06.962
We have a problem.

02:04:08.130 --> 02:04:10.882
I think together we can
solve all our problems.

02:04:13.135 --> 02:04:15.679
We all know you have tax
troubles in your country

02:04:15.762 --> 02:04:18.473
and that you may have
to do a little time.

02:04:19.099 --> 02:04:20.684
We have friends
in Washington

02:04:20.767 --> 02:04:23.854
that assure us these troubles
can be taken care of.

02:04:23.937 --> 02:04:27.482
You may have to pay some back
taxes, a big fine,

02:04:28.275 --> 02:04:30.402
but there will be
no prison.

02:04:31.069 --> 02:04:32.070
Okay.

02:04:32.988 --> 02:04:34.948
So what's
your problem, Alex?

02:04:35.991 --> 02:04:37.784
I'll show you my problem.

02:04:38.326 --> 02:04:41.496
<i>I've heard about financial
support your government receives</i>

02:04:41.580 --> 02:04:43.415
<i>from the drug industry
in Bolivia.</i>

02:04:43.498 --> 02:04:46.793
<i>Well, the irony of this
is that this money,</i>

02:04:46.918 --> 02:04:48.420
<i>which is
in the billions,</i>

02:04:48.628 --> 02:04:50.380
<i>is coming
from your country.</i>

02:04:50.463 --> 02:04:54.301
<i>You are the major purchaser
of our national product,</i>

02:04:54.426 --> 02:04:56.178
<i>which is cocaine.</i>

02:04:56.261 --> 02:04:58.513
<i>On one hand,
you're saying the U.S. government</i>

02:04:58.597 --> 02:05:00.724
<i>is spending millions
to eliminate</i>

02:05:00.807 --> 02:05:02.934
<i>the flow of drugs
onto our streets.</i>

02:05:03.185 --> 02:05:04.811
<i>At the same time,</i>

02:05:04.936 --> 02:05:07.772
<i>we are doing business
with the same government</i>

02:05:07.981 --> 02:05:10.525
<i>that is flooding
our streets with cocaine.</i>

02:05:10.859 --> 02:05:13.445
<i>Let me show you a few
of the other characters</i>

02:05:13.528 --> 02:05:15.780
<i>that are involved
in this tragic comedy.</i>

02:05:15.864 --> 02:05:18.283
<i>My organization
just recently traced</i>

02:05:18.366 --> 02:05:21.161
<i>a large purchase
by this man.</i>

02:05:21.828 --> 02:05:25.457
<i>This charming face here
belongs to General Cucombre.</i>

02:05:25.707 --> 02:05:28.960
<i>He is the Minister of the
Defense of Bolivia, my country.</i>

02:05:29.461 --> 02:05:31.880
<i>And General Cucombre just
a couple months ago</i>

02:05:31.963 --> 02:05:36.801
<i>bought a $12 million villa on
Lake Lucerne in Switzerland.</i>

02:05:37.302 --> 02:05:38.553
<i>Now, if Cucombre
is supposed to be</i>

02:05:38.637 --> 02:05:39.763
<i>the Bolivian
Defense Minister,</i>

02:05:39.846 --> 02:05:42.098
<i>what is he doing
living in Switzerland?</i>

02:05:42.182 --> 02:05:43.683
<i>Guarding cash registers?</i>

02:05:44.809 --> 02:05:47.771
<i>This man here,
Alejandro Sosa,</i>

02:05:47.854 --> 02:05:49.147
<i>a very interesting character.</i>

02:05:49.356 --> 02:05:51.024
<i>He's a wealthy landowner,</i>

02:05:51.149 --> 02:05:53.693
<i>educated in England,
very good family.</i>

02:05:53.985 --> 02:05:57.989
<i>But this man is the business
brain and drug overlord</i>

02:05:58.240 --> 02:06:00.992
<i>of an empire that
stretches across the Andes.</i>

02:06:01.076 --> 02:06:03.662
<i>He's not your
ordinary drug dealer.</i>

02:06:04.204 --> 02:06:06.248
<i>Well, discussing it openly...</i>

02:06:07.999 --> 02:06:10.418
He's scheduled
for <i>60 Minutes</i> next.

02:06:11.002 --> 02:06:16.549
He is going on French,
British, Italian,
Japanese television.

02:06:17.133 --> 02:06:20.053
People everywhere are
starting to listen to him.

02:06:20.512 --> 02:06:22.222
It's embarrassing, Tony.

02:06:24.432 --> 02:06:26.726
That is our problem.

02:06:29.354 --> 02:06:31.606
You remember Alberto,
don't you?

02:06:32.941 --> 02:06:34.651
How could I forget him?

02:06:35.360 --> 02:06:38.738
Alberto is an expert
in the disposal business.

02:06:39.739 --> 02:06:42.117
He's going to help us
fix our problem.

02:06:43.910 --> 02:06:45.870
But he doesn't
speak English.

02:06:46.621 --> 02:06:49.624
He doesn't know his way
around the States too well.

02:06:49.874 --> 02:06:51.835
He needs a little help.

02:06:54.045 --> 02:06:55.964
Is that a problem, Tony?

02:07:01.886 --> 02:07:03.513
No problem.

02:07:06.057 --> 02:07:07.183
Good.

02:07:22.490 --> 02:07:26.494
So what's the big mystery
with the Bolivian situation?

02:07:26.870 --> 02:07:29.873
You gonna tell me what
happened with Sosa, or what?

02:07:30.081 --> 02:07:33.376
A lot of bullshit,
that's what happened.

02:07:34.252 --> 02:07:35.420
Politics.

02:07:40.216 --> 02:07:43.511
I want you to stay
down here for a while.

02:07:44.721 --> 02:07:46.431
Run things for me.

02:07:47.182 --> 02:07:49.351
I gotta go to
New York next week.

02:07:55.690 --> 02:07:56.941
Fuck this, man.

02:07:57.067 --> 02:07:59.944
I don't like it, man.
I don't like this at all.

02:08:00.070 --> 02:08:01.738
You don't like it?

02:08:04.783 --> 02:08:08.036
You got me into this
mess in the first place.

02:08:08.119 --> 02:08:11.873
With that fucking
Seidelbaum, that right?

02:08:11.956 --> 02:08:13.291
With Seidelbaum?

02:08:13.416 --> 02:08:15.627
What does Seidelbaum
have to do with Sosa?

02:08:15.710 --> 02:08:18.463
How do you connect
those two?

02:08:18.880 --> 02:08:21.466
Why don't you eat your food?
What's wrong with it?

02:08:21.591 --> 02:08:23.635
I'm not hungry.

02:08:24.302 --> 02:08:25.387
You're not hungry?

02:08:25.470 --> 02:08:27.305
Do you even know
about the trial?

02:08:27.472 --> 02:08:29.182
What did you
order it for, then?

02:08:29.265 --> 02:08:31.601
I lost my appetite.

02:08:36.773 --> 02:08:38.316
Do you even know
that Sheffield said

02:08:38.400 --> 02:08:40.568
he can get you
a postponement?

02:08:47.951 --> 02:08:52.122
Is this it?
That's what it's all about?

02:08:55.333 --> 02:08:58.753
Eating, drinking,

02:08:59.254 --> 02:09:01.423
fucking, sucking...

02:09:01.506 --> 02:09:02.841
Come on, man.

02:09:02.924 --> 02:09:04.259
Snorting?

02:09:04.342 --> 02:09:05.510
Then what?

02:09:07.178 --> 02:09:09.013
Tell me. Then what?

02:09:09.973 --> 02:09:14.477
You're 50.
You got a bag for a belly.

02:09:15.854 --> 02:09:18.648
You got tits,
you need a bra.

02:09:19.482 --> 02:09:21.025
They got hair on them.

02:09:22.277 --> 02:09:25.613
You got a liver,
and they got spots on it

02:09:25.697 --> 02:09:27.782
and you're eating
this fucking shit

02:09:28.283 --> 02:09:31.828
and you're looking like these
rich fucking mummies in here.

02:09:32.036 --> 02:09:34.706
Come on.
It's not so bad.
It could be worse.

02:09:35.373 --> 02:09:36.708
Is this what
it's all about?

02:09:36.791 --> 02:09:37.876
Forget it.

02:09:38.042 --> 02:09:41.045
This what I work for?
Tell me.

02:09:46.634 --> 02:09:47.886
Look at that.

02:09:48.970 --> 02:09:50.305
A junkie.

02:09:52.056 --> 02:09:56.436
I got a fucking junkie for a wife.
She don't eat nothing.

02:09:57.604 --> 02:10:01.399
Sleeps all day with
them black shades on.

02:10:03.067 --> 02:10:04.360
Wakes up
with a Quaalude...

02:10:04.444 --> 02:10:05.737
Don't pick on her, man.

02:10:05.862 --> 02:10:09.574
...and who won't fuck me
'cause she's in a coma.

02:10:11.242 --> 02:10:13.661
I can't even
have a kid with her.

02:10:13.745 --> 02:10:16.456
Her womb
is so polluted,

02:10:16.581 --> 02:10:19.542
I can't even have a fucking
little baby with her!

02:10:19.626 --> 02:10:21.961
You son of a bitch!

02:10:22.921 --> 02:10:24.589
You fuck!

02:10:24.923 --> 02:10:26.341
You shouldn't talk
like that.

02:10:26.424 --> 02:10:28.635
How dare you talk
to me like that!

02:10:29.928 --> 02:10:32.305
What makes you
so much better than me?

02:10:32.764 --> 02:10:34.057
What do you do?
Don't worry.

02:10:34.140 --> 02:10:36.392
You deal drugs
and you kill people.

02:10:36.476 --> 02:10:37.769
Oh, that's wonderful, Tony.

02:10:38.436 --> 02:10:40.772
Real contribution
to human history.

02:10:40.897 --> 02:10:42.273
Go ahead.
Tell everybody.

02:10:42.357 --> 02:10:43.691
You want a kid?

02:10:43.775 --> 02:10:45.109
Tell the world.

02:10:45.235 --> 02:10:48.112
What kind of a father
would you make?

02:10:49.447 --> 02:10:51.908
Gonna drive him to school
in the mornings?

02:10:51.991 --> 02:10:55.620
Are you even gonna be alive by
the time the kid goes to school?

02:10:57.121 --> 02:10:58.998
You don't know
how to be a husband!

02:10:59.082 --> 02:11:00.083
Sit down before I...

02:11:00.166 --> 02:11:02.669
Do we ever go anywhere
without having 600 thugs

02:11:02.794 --> 02:11:04.462
hanging around
all the time?

02:11:04.837 --> 02:11:08.591
I have Nick "The Pig"
as a friend.

02:11:10.093 --> 02:11:13.096
What kind of life
is that?

02:11:17.517 --> 02:11:18.977
Can't you see

02:11:21.312 --> 02:11:24.023
what we're becoming, Tony?
We're losers.

02:11:24.983 --> 02:11:27.277
We're not winners,
we're losers.

02:11:28.278 --> 02:11:30.029
Go home.
You're stoned.

02:11:30.113 --> 02:11:32.323
I'm not stoned,
you're stoned.

02:11:32.615 --> 02:11:33.700
Get her out of here.

02:11:33.783 --> 02:11:34.993
Come on.

02:11:37.370 --> 02:11:39.289
I'm not going home
with you.

02:11:40.790 --> 02:11:42.834
I'm not going home
with anybody.

02:11:44.669 --> 02:11:46.212
I'm going home alone.

02:11:51.884 --> 02:11:53.219
I'm leaving you.

02:11:55.722 --> 02:11:57.724
I don't need
this shit anymore.

02:11:58.224 --> 02:12:00.018
Okay, but I'll
walk you out.

02:12:00.101 --> 02:12:01.311
I'll take her home
in a cab.

02:12:01.394 --> 02:12:03.646
Let her go.

02:12:04.230 --> 02:12:07.066
Another Quaalude,
she gonna love me again.

02:12:14.616 --> 02:12:16.200
What're you looking at?

02:12:23.166 --> 02:12:25.543
You're all a bunch
of fucking assholes.

02:12:26.878 --> 02:12:28.379
You know why?

02:12:30.256 --> 02:12:33.509
You don't have the guts
to be what you want to be.

02:12:37.055 --> 02:12:39.390
You need people like me.

02:12:45.063 --> 02:12:46.606
You need people like me

02:12:46.689 --> 02:12:49.400
so you can point
your fucking fingers

02:12:49.942 --> 02:12:52.278
and say,
"That's the bad guy."

02:12:55.239 --> 02:12:58.993
So, what does
that make you?

02:12:59.619 --> 02:13:00.662
Good?

02:13:03.539 --> 02:13:05.291
You're not good.

02:13:07.502 --> 02:13:09.420
You just know
how to hide,

02:13:11.130 --> 02:13:12.423
how to lie.

02:13:15.093 --> 02:13:18.513
Me, I don't have
that problem.

02:13:20.223 --> 02:13:23.434
Me, I always
tell the truth.

02:13:25.144 --> 02:13:26.854
Even when I lie.

02:13:36.030 --> 02:13:38.574
So say good night
to the bad guy!

02:13:39.200 --> 02:13:40.451
Come on.

02:13:42.662 --> 02:13:45.540
The last time you gonna see
a bad guy like this again,

02:13:45.623 --> 02:13:46.999
let me tell you.

02:13:48.209 --> 02:13:51.587
Come on. Make way
for the bad guy.

02:13:53.047 --> 02:13:55.550
There's a bad guy
coming through!

02:13:56.300 --> 02:13:57.969
Better get out
of his way!

02:15:25.473 --> 02:15:29.185
No. You tell Sheffield to
keep his nose out of it.

02:15:29.393 --> 02:15:30.728
There's gonna be no trial.

02:15:30.812 --> 02:15:32.730
I got it all
under control now.

02:15:33.147 --> 02:15:35.233
Just tell him to
stay out of it!

02:15:35.775 --> 02:15:38.194
Okay, what about Elvira?
Did she call?

02:15:41.572 --> 02:15:42.990
Yeah, all right.

02:15:58.422 --> 02:16:00.174
Tony,
everything go okay?

02:16:00.508 --> 02:16:02.301
Yeah,
everything is roses.

02:16:06.180 --> 02:16:08.015
Ernie, what time
do you got?

02:16:08.182 --> 02:16:10.059
Ten to.

02:16:10.142 --> 02:16:11.185
Ten to.

02:16:11.269 --> 02:16:12.520
Where is this guy, man?

02:16:12.603 --> 02:16:13.855
I gotta call
Manny again.

02:16:15.439 --> 02:16:16.983
You don't tell me
what to do here!

02:16:17.066 --> 02:16:18.067
He's coming out.

02:16:18.150 --> 02:16:19.318
He's coming.

02:16:20.653 --> 02:16:21.821
I don't give a fuck.

02:16:21.904 --> 02:16:23.030
It's him, man.

02:16:30.538 --> 02:16:32.748
I don't care
where you blow him up.

02:16:33.374 --> 02:16:34.876
Tell me when, okay?

02:16:36.669 --> 02:16:39.505
You just tell me when.
That's all I care about.

02:16:49.724 --> 02:16:51.851
I heard you
the first time.

02:16:51.934 --> 02:16:54.228
One time.
That's all you gotta tell me.

02:16:58.107 --> 02:17:00.359
This fucking guy,
I'm telling you.

02:17:02.987 --> 02:17:04.739
Look.
Here he comes.

02:17:07.658 --> 02:17:09.744
Where's he going?

02:17:09.952 --> 02:17:11.662
What's he doing
that way?

02:17:23.049 --> 02:17:24.717
What the fuck he doing?

02:17:38.522 --> 02:17:40.608
What the fuck is that?
Come here.

02:17:40.691 --> 02:17:42.777
You said she took the kids
in the other car!

02:17:42.860 --> 02:17:45.196
She did,
every fucking day.

02:17:45.279 --> 02:17:46.739
I don't know
what's going on.

02:17:49.158 --> 02:17:52.995
No fucking way.
No fucking way.
That's it!

02:18:05.633 --> 02:18:07.593
This fucking guy.

02:18:44.839 --> 02:18:46.841
Fuck you,
you fucking vulture.

02:18:50.970 --> 02:18:55.016
Two little kids in the car.
This is so fucking bad.

02:18:55.850 --> 02:18:57.852
This is so fucking bad.

02:19:01.731 --> 02:19:03.816
I see them, all right?
I see them!

02:19:09.530 --> 02:19:11.115
Shut the fuck up, okay?

02:19:23.794 --> 02:19:27.465
You don't have the guts to look
them in the eye when you kill them.

02:19:27.631 --> 02:19:29.091
You gotta hide
with that shit...

02:19:30.301 --> 02:19:32.011
He's getting up.
Let's do it.

02:19:32.094 --> 02:19:33.721
Make you feel good?

02:19:34.221 --> 02:19:36.432
Make you feel good to
kill a mama and her kids?

02:19:36.515 --> 02:19:37.683
Make you feel big.

02:19:39.101 --> 02:19:40.978
Like you, big man!
Fuck you!

02:19:41.687 --> 02:19:43.105
What do you think I am?

02:19:43.189 --> 02:19:45.357
You think I kill
two kids and a woman?

02:19:45.524 --> 02:19:48.944
Fuck that!
I don't need that
shit in my life!

02:19:51.280 --> 02:19:53.240
You die, motherfucker!

02:19:58.204 --> 02:19:59.705
What do you think
I am, huh?

02:19:59.789 --> 02:20:01.957
You think I'm a
fucking worm like you?

02:20:02.249 --> 02:20:05.795
I told you, man!
I told you,
don't fuck with me!

02:20:06.003 --> 02:20:08.297
I told you,
no fucking kids!

02:20:08.422 --> 02:20:10.007
No, but you
wouldn't listen!

02:20:10.091 --> 02:20:12.551
You stupid fuck!
Look at you now.

02:20:18.057 --> 02:20:20.351
Nick,
where the fuck you been?

02:20:21.644 --> 02:20:23.062
On a delivery?

02:20:23.896 --> 02:20:25.856
Where the hell
is Manny?

02:20:25.940 --> 02:20:27.817
I been calling all over.
Where is he?

02:20:27.900 --> 02:20:30.319
I don't know, Tony.

02:20:30.402 --> 02:20:32.238
He's been gone
the last couple of days.

02:20:32.321 --> 02:20:33.531
<i>He didn't say nothing.</i>

02:20:33.614 --> 02:20:34.782
He's gone?
What? Where?

02:20:34.865 --> 02:20:38.786
I left him in fucking charge, man!
Where the fuck is he?

02:20:38.911 --> 02:20:41.247
You can't trust
nobody anymore!

02:20:41.330 --> 02:20:44.750
I don't know, Tony.
He just took off.

02:20:44.834 --> 02:20:45.960
<i>He didn't say nothing.</i>

02:20:46.043 --> 02:20:47.086
He took off?

02:20:47.878 --> 02:20:49.130
<i>Are you all right?</i>

02:20:49.213 --> 02:20:51.257
No, I'm not all right!
I'm pissed!

02:20:51.340 --> 02:20:52.508
When I get back there,

02:20:52.591 --> 02:20:54.635
I'll kick some ass
all over the place!

02:20:54.718 --> 02:20:56.137
<i>When you coming back?</i>

02:20:56.220 --> 02:20:57.555
I'm coming back tonight!

02:20:57.888 --> 02:20:59.974
This fucking cocksucker.

02:21:00.599 --> 02:21:04.979
Tony, your mama called.
Gina's gone.

02:21:06.772 --> 02:21:08.023
Gone? Where?

02:21:08.107 --> 02:21:09.984
<i>She got to see you
right away.</i>

02:21:10.067 --> 02:21:13.779
Tell her
I'll call her tonight.

02:21:13.988 --> 02:21:17.158
Listen to me.
What about Elvie?
She call?

02:21:17.283 --> 02:21:18.409
<i>No.</i>

02:21:18.492 --> 02:21:19.577
No.

02:21:19.660 --> 02:21:21.412
Okay, listen to me.

02:21:21.495 --> 02:21:23.831
If she calls,
just tell her I love her.

02:21:23.914 --> 02:21:26.083
Okay?
Just tell her that.

02:21:49.899 --> 02:21:51.734
You hear from Manny?
No.

02:21:51.817 --> 02:21:53.694
Your mama called,
she gotta see you.

02:21:53.777 --> 02:21:57.907
Sosa's been ringing every half hour.
He sounds pissed.

02:21:57.990 --> 02:21:59.700
Get him on the phone.
Elvie call?

02:21:59.783 --> 02:22:00.784
No.

02:22:03.829 --> 02:22:06.790
You keep trying Manny.
I want that cocksucker here.

02:22:06.874 --> 02:22:07.958
I want him here now!
Okay?

02:22:08.042 --> 02:22:09.084
Okay.

02:22:09.168 --> 02:22:12.338
Come on.
Go ahead, get him!
Let's go. Come on!

02:22:27.019 --> 02:22:31.440
Yeah? Mama.
Yeah, I know.

02:22:32.358 --> 02:22:35.027
They told me.

02:22:35.110 --> 02:22:37.071
Okay. I'm coming over.

02:22:37.154 --> 02:22:41.825
I'll be over to see you.
I'll be over, yeah.

02:22:44.119 --> 02:22:46.080
Put it on the speaker.

02:22:56.131 --> 02:22:58.259
<i>What happened, Tony?</i>

02:22:59.218 --> 02:23:00.636
Alex, how you doing?

02:23:00.719 --> 02:23:02.137
<i>What happened?</i>

02:23:02.471 --> 02:23:04.807
Oh, we had
some problems.

02:23:07.059 --> 02:23:08.060
Alex?

02:23:08.143 --> 02:23:09.478
<i>Tony, what happened?</i>

02:23:12.982 --> 02:23:14.108
We had a little problem.

02:23:14.191 --> 02:23:15.234
<i>I heard.</i>

02:23:15.317 --> 02:23:16.485
How you hear that?

02:23:16.568 --> 02:23:18.737
Our friend gave
a speech at the UN.

02:23:18.821 --> 02:23:21.782
He was not supposed
to give that speech.

02:23:24.076 --> 02:23:27.413
Well, your guy, Alberto,
he's a piece of shit.

02:23:27.496 --> 02:23:29.748
I told him to do something,
he didn't listen,

02:23:29.832 --> 02:23:31.333
so I canceled
his contract.

02:23:31.417 --> 02:23:33.877
My partners and I
are pissed off.

02:23:34.420 --> 02:23:36.213
That's okay.
No big deal.

02:23:36.422 --> 02:23:39.466
There's other Albertos.
We'll do it next month.

02:23:39.717 --> 02:23:41.760
No, Tony,
you can't do that.

02:23:42.303 --> 02:23:45.306
They found what
was under the car.

02:23:46.181 --> 02:23:48.851
Now our friend has got
security up the ass.

02:23:49.143 --> 02:23:52.688
<i>The heat will come down
hard on my partners and me.</i>

02:23:53.480 --> 02:23:55.441
There's not
gonna be a next time,

02:23:55.524 --> 02:23:57.359
<i>you dumb cocksucker!
You blew it!</i>

02:23:57.443 --> 02:23:59.236
Take it easy
when you talk to me.

02:23:59.361 --> 02:24:04.199
I told you a long time ago,
you fucking monkey,
not to fuck me!

02:24:04.283 --> 02:24:06.243
Who the fuck you think
you're talking to, huh?

02:24:06.327 --> 02:24:07.536
<i>You want to fuck with...</i>

02:24:07.911 --> 02:24:11.332
Who the fuck you think I am,
your fucking bellboy?

02:24:11.999 --> 02:24:14.918
You want to go to war?
We take you to war, okay?

02:24:16.670 --> 02:24:19.089
Alex, you there? Hey!

02:24:19.173 --> 02:24:22.634
He's not there.
<i>CÃ¡lmate,</i> man.

02:24:24.053 --> 02:24:27.931
She got a place of her own.
She don't tell me where.

02:24:28.140 --> 02:24:30.476
One night,
I follow her in a taxi.

02:24:30.601 --> 02:24:33.270
She goes to a fancy house
in Coconut Grove.

02:24:34.313 --> 02:24:36.106
Where'd she get the money?
You!

02:24:36.231 --> 02:24:37.608
You were giving
her the money!

02:24:37.733 --> 02:24:39.193
You see what
you do to her?

02:24:39.276 --> 02:24:40.444
I don't give her
that much money.

02:24:40.527 --> 02:24:41.653
You did!

02:24:41.779 --> 02:24:43.572
One time,
$1,000 you gave her.

02:24:43.655 --> 02:24:44.907
Was a guy with her?

02:24:45.616 --> 02:24:47.576
I don't know.

02:24:47.826 --> 02:24:50.037
There was this car
in the driveway.

02:24:50.120 --> 02:24:51.872
I know if I go there,
she'll kill me.

02:24:51.955 --> 02:24:52.998
She's like you.

02:24:53.082 --> 02:24:54.750
Where's the place?
Where is it?

02:24:54.958 --> 02:24:57.920
400 something...

02:24:58.003 --> 02:24:59.171
Citrus Drive.

02:24:59.296 --> 02:25:01.632
400 what?
409, I think.

02:25:01.924 --> 02:25:05.094
You gotta talk to her, Antonio.
She don't listen to me.

02:25:05.177 --> 02:25:07.012
She says to me,
<i>"Mira,</i> shut up!

02:25:07.137 --> 02:25:08.347
"Mind your own business."

02:25:08.472 --> 02:25:10.307
Exactly like
you do to me.

02:25:10.432 --> 02:25:13.185
Ever since you came back,
she's been getting this way.

02:25:13.310 --> 02:25:14.395
I gotta go.

02:25:14.478 --> 02:25:15.979
Why do you have
to hurt everything?

02:25:16.105 --> 02:25:18.107
Why do you have
to destroy

02:25:18.190 --> 02:25:20.484
everything that
comes your way?

02:25:24.530 --> 02:25:25.906
409 Citrus Drive.

02:25:25.989 --> 02:25:27.032
Okay.

02:25:27.324 --> 02:25:29.368
Tony, I can't
find Manny anywhere.

02:25:29.451 --> 02:25:30.494
Fuck!

02:25:30.869 --> 02:25:33.664
Okay. Listen, boss,
I'll try again.

02:26:06.697 --> 02:26:09.992
You stay here.
Keep trying Manny, okay?

02:26:56.246 --> 02:26:57.372
Tony.

02:28:09.486 --> 02:28:12.322
We got married
just yesterday.

02:28:12.406 --> 02:28:14.116
We were gonna
surprise you.

02:28:19.830 --> 02:28:21.331
Jesus, Tony.

02:28:21.832 --> 02:28:24.001
Tony, we gotta
get outta here, man.

02:28:24.084 --> 02:28:25.294
We gotta
get outta here.

02:28:25.836 --> 02:28:27.504
Go get Gina.

02:28:35.679 --> 02:28:36.847
No!

02:28:43.520 --> 02:28:46.398
No, Gina.
Come on, Gina. No!

02:28:46.523 --> 02:28:48.150
God!

02:28:56.491 --> 02:28:58.201
Tony, we can't stay here.
We gotta go.

02:28:58.327 --> 02:29:00.203
We gotta
get out of here.

02:29:40.077 --> 02:29:41.453
Come on, Gina.

02:29:45.082 --> 02:29:47.292
Here we go.
It's gonna be okay.

02:29:47.417 --> 02:29:49.544
You got her?
I got her.

02:30:16.947 --> 02:30:20.826
No!
This is Tony's place!
Let me go!

02:31:05.829 --> 02:31:07.330
We put some
pills into her.

02:31:07.414 --> 02:31:08.749
She's gonna be
all right, Tony.

02:31:08.832 --> 02:31:10.542
She's cooling down.
Right?

02:31:10.625 --> 02:31:12.419
She's gonna be fine.
Just fine.

02:31:12.502 --> 02:31:13.587
Right.

02:31:16.214 --> 02:31:18.049
What are we
gonna do now?

02:31:22.512 --> 02:31:23.722
Do?

02:31:28.560 --> 02:31:30.228
We're going to war.

02:31:31.438 --> 02:31:33.607
That's what
we're gonna do.

02:31:37.152 --> 02:31:40.238
We're gonna eat that
Sosa for breakfast!

02:31:42.574 --> 02:31:45.202
Close that fucker down.

02:31:51.082 --> 02:31:53.126
Tony, take it easy.

02:32:00.842 --> 02:32:02.052
All right, Ernie.
Let's go.

02:32:02.135 --> 02:32:04.179
We'll take care
of the house.

02:33:15.208 --> 02:33:17.085
Come on.

02:33:17.168 --> 02:33:19.671
This cocksucker's
gonna run all over you.

02:33:36.438 --> 02:33:39.357
Come on. I'll bury
these cocksuckers.

02:33:48.283 --> 02:33:50.952
We gotta
get organized here.

02:34:02.130 --> 02:34:05.383
Fuck! Manny.

02:34:12.182 --> 02:34:14.184
How the fuck
I do that?

02:34:18.313 --> 02:34:20.732
How the fuck
I do that, Manny?

02:35:32.220 --> 02:35:33.346
Tony.

02:35:42.564 --> 02:35:43.565
Gina.

02:36:00.999 --> 02:36:03.126
Is this what
you want, Tony?

02:36:14.304 --> 02:36:17.223
You can't stand for another
man to be touching me.

02:36:19.642 --> 02:36:21.519
So you want me,
Tony, huh?

02:36:22.395 --> 02:36:23.480
Huh?

02:36:25.273 --> 02:36:26.775
What are you
talking about?

02:36:26.900 --> 02:36:28.318
Ah.

02:36:28.401 --> 02:36:29.861
Is that it?

02:36:33.740 --> 02:36:35.116
Here I am, Tony.

02:36:40.080 --> 02:36:42.290
I am all yours now,
Tony, you see?

02:36:45.085 --> 02:36:46.711
I'm all yours now.

02:36:47.670 --> 02:36:48.671
Gina.

02:36:49.422 --> 02:36:51.674
You better come
and get me now.

02:36:52.592 --> 02:36:54.511
All right. Come on.
Come and get me.

02:36:54.594 --> 02:36:56.054
Come and get me.

02:36:57.055 --> 02:36:58.973
You do it now
before it's too late.

02:37:02.519 --> 02:37:03.728
Oh, come on, Tony.

02:37:05.897 --> 02:37:07.065
Fuck me.

02:37:11.111 --> 02:37:13.530
Fuck me. Come on
and just fuck me!

02:37:30.421 --> 02:37:31.464
Die!

02:37:45.603 --> 02:37:48.314
They're all over the place!
Get out of here!

02:37:57.824 --> 02:37:58.825
Gina.

02:38:11.713 --> 02:38:15.884
Come on.
Look at your face.
It's all dirty.

02:38:33.443 --> 02:38:35.028
Please talk to me.

02:38:36.863 --> 02:38:38.406
Don't be mad at me.

02:38:38.656 --> 02:38:41.993
Please. Gina, come on.

02:38:43.786 --> 02:38:47.457
I love Manny, you know?

02:38:47.790 --> 02:38:49.042
I love him.

02:38:51.085 --> 02:38:53.588
And I love you, too,
you know?

02:39:20.323 --> 02:39:21.616
Give me a smile.

02:39:21.699 --> 02:39:23.076
They're coming
from everywhere!

02:39:23.159 --> 02:39:25.995
Tony, open up!
Open the fucking door!

02:39:27.622 --> 02:39:29.624
Please! Tony!

02:39:29.707 --> 02:39:31.709
Let me in, boss!
Please!

02:39:31.918 --> 02:39:33.962
Tony,
open the fucking door!

02:39:55.858 --> 02:40:00.989
You wait here, okay?
I'll be with you.
I'll be back.

02:40:04.492 --> 02:40:06.828
You wait for me.
I'm coming back.

02:40:10.707 --> 02:40:13.126
Okay, Sosa.
You want to fuck with me?

02:40:17.755 --> 02:40:19.340
You're fucking
with the best!

02:40:24.137 --> 02:40:25.847
You want to fuck with me?

02:40:27.640 --> 02:40:29.434
You cockroaches.

02:40:32.770 --> 02:40:35.523
You want to play games?
Okay, I play with you.

02:40:40.320 --> 02:40:41.946
You wanna play rough?

02:40:43.448 --> 02:40:45.616
Say hello to
my little friend!

02:40:48.953 --> 02:40:50.538
You want to play rough?

02:40:51.706 --> 02:40:54.542
There! You like that?

02:40:56.419 --> 02:40:57.712
You want more?

02:41:04.802 --> 02:41:06.012
You whores!

02:41:07.430 --> 02:41:08.556
Cowards!

02:41:56.187 --> 02:41:57.688
Want to fuck with me?

02:42:14.539 --> 02:42:16.290
Go ahead!

02:42:17.750 --> 02:42:18.793
Come on!

02:42:21.504 --> 02:42:24.215
How do you
like that, huh?

02:42:24.465 --> 02:42:26.426
You fucking <i>maricÃ³n!</i>

02:42:28.845 --> 02:42:30.555
You think
you can take me?

02:42:30.638 --> 02:42:32.890
You need a fucking army
if you gonna take me!

02:42:32.974 --> 02:42:37.311
You hear? Come on!
I take you all to fucking hell!

02:42:43.151 --> 02:42:46.362
Who you think you fucking with?
I'm Tony Montana!

02:42:47.280 --> 02:42:49.866
You fuck with me,
you fucking with the best!

02:42:54.078 --> 02:42:55.663
I'm still standing.

02:42:59.959 --> 02:43:02.462
Come on! I take
your fucking bullet!

02:43:04.046 --> 02:43:05.965
Come on! I take
your fucking bullet!

02:43:06.048 --> 02:43:07.800
You think you kill me
with bullets?

02:43:07.884 --> 02:43:09.886
I take your fucking bullets!
Go ahead!
