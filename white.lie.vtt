There is information, you can
sign up for the newsletter...

02:10.378 --> 02:12.581
Events and opportunities to...
hey!

02:12.615 --> 02:17.453
...Get involved, so, Katie has a
rare form of melanoma...

02:17.485 --> 02:19.923
All the money we raise towards
getting her to the States

02:19.955 --> 02:22.125
for this really great
research...

02:48.751 --> 02:51.788
<i>You have reached... Owen.</i>

02:51.820 --> 02:54.424
Owen, it's me. I need to meet
with you as soon as possible.

02:54.456 --> 02:56.626
Call me back, okay?

03:09.372 --> 03:12.108
Hey, guys, let's get started.

03:12.140 --> 03:14.143
We're picking up from the
trio....

03:14.175 --> 03:17.446
I want to see the diagonal
phrase... Come on, honey.

03:21.850 --> 03:24.120
Remember the notes from
Thursday, please.

03:24.152 --> 03:26.155
From the unison section?

03:26.187 --> 03:30.592
Exactly. I want you,
Lydia, and Luke here. Come on in.

03:30.626 --> 03:33.830
All right, let's start there and
see how it goes.

03:33.862 --> 03:35.798
Music.

03:45.574 --> 03:46.843
Fuck!

03:46.876 --> 03:48.711
Okay, let's stop that.

03:48.743 --> 03:50.445
Sorry, sorry. I know it, I
just...

03:50.479 --> 03:52.048
do you think we can go from the
beginning?

03:52.080 --> 03:53.316
Just so I can get into it?

03:53.348 --> 03:54.549
Yeah, yeah, let's do that.

03:54.582 --> 03:56.118
- Can you find the beginning?
- Okay.

03:56.151 --> 03:57.352
All right, first places.

04:35.591 --> 04:36.858
- Katie?
- Yeah?

04:36.891 --> 04:38.161
My mom wanted to give
this to you.

04:38.194 --> 04:39.528
Oh, that is so sweet.

04:39.562 --> 04:41.230
Yeah, she tried donating online,

04:41.262 --> 04:43.098
but she just couldn't,
she's old.

04:43.132 --> 04:45.033
No, this is great.
This is so nice.

04:45.067 --> 04:46.269
I'll have to email her.

04:46.302 --> 04:48.037
Okay.

04:48.069 --> 04:49.271
Nice job today!

04:49.305 --> 04:50.540
Thank you!

04:50.572 --> 04:52.442
We good for Wednesday?

04:52.475 --> 04:53.876
We added a new part to
our piece,

04:53.908 --> 04:55.211
we'd love to hear what
you think!

04:55.244 --> 04:58.748
Yeah, totally. Looking
forward to it!

04:58.781 --> 05:02.218
I'll just sign a few things, and
then I'll be out of your way.

05:02.250 --> 05:04.553
Oh, did you not get my message?

05:04.586 --> 05:06.288
What do you mean?

05:06.322 --> 05:09.559
Um, Emmy Schreiner
from the Jingwen... sorry.

05:09.591 --> 05:12.228
I always trip on this, the
Jingwen Zhan Foundation...

05:12.261 --> 05:14.564
flagged an issue with your
application.

05:14.596 --> 05:16.364
Come on and sit down.

05:16.398 --> 05:18.534
Oh, um, what's the issue?

05:18.567 --> 05:21.204
She didn't receive copies of
your medical records.

05:21.237 --> 05:24.373
Oh, I-I sent those over.

05:24.406 --> 05:28.411
So when we last
met on September 14th,

05:28.444 --> 05:30.913
you'd put in a request to have a
copy of your records

05:30.946 --> 05:32.148
mailed to their offices,
correct?

05:32.180 --> 05:33.615
Yeah, I did that.

05:33.649 --> 05:35.384
- Well...
- Did they not get them?

05:35.416 --> 05:37.552
- No.
- That's super weird.

05:37.586 --> 05:39.889
Actually, this happens all
the time.

05:39.922 --> 05:42.959
I-I had them sent in, I called
my doctor.

05:42.992 --> 05:46.395
And the nurse said... or the
receptionist,

05:46.427 --> 05:49.165
said that she would have them
sent in right away.

05:49.197 --> 05:50.599
They already charged my
credit card.

05:50.632 --> 05:52.267
Regardless, it's really
important that they

05:52.300 --> 05:54.170
receive those files.

05:54.202 --> 05:57.173
Okay, I'll just call them again.
Shouldn't be an issue.

05:57.206 --> 05:59.509
Okay, great, because we're right
down to the wire now.

05:59.541 --> 06:02.644
What do you mean?

06:02.677 --> 06:04.480
Well, the submission deadline
is on Friday,

06:04.512 --> 06:07.149
so all of your records and your
paperwork have to be in by then.

06:09.651 --> 06:13.322
I-I just thought I was coming
in to sign for a cheque.

06:13.355 --> 06:17.160
This money could really make a
difference for me, so...

06:17.192 --> 06:20.129
I know,
and I'm not unsympathetic.

06:21.297 --> 06:23.366
How many applicants are there?

06:23.399 --> 06:26.201
Um, the numbers change
every year,

06:26.235 --> 06:30.306
so I'm not exactly sure, but
there are usually a lot.

06:30.338 --> 06:33.475
But they like you, Katie. I
thought you'd be great for this,

06:33.509 --> 06:35.878
with your charity work, and the
impact you've had on campus.

06:35.911 --> 06:39.348
When I heard about you, we
thought that you'd be great.

06:39.380 --> 06:41.383
And I'm friendly with the
foundation,

06:41.416 --> 06:42.784
and I think that you are a
shoe-in.

06:42.817 --> 06:44.152
They really want to support you.

06:44.185 --> 06:46.221
So just get your medical records
in order,

06:46.254 --> 06:47.490
and we'll see to the rest.

06:47.523 --> 06:49.759
Yeah, shouldn't be a problem.

07:20.021 --> 07:21.257
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:26.127 --> 07:28.497
Thanks for meeting me.

07:28.529 --> 07:32.400
I don't have any Stemetil,
but I have Dexamethasone.

07:32.434 --> 07:34.403
What's that?

07:34.435 --> 07:36.872
It's a steroid to reduce brain
swelling, it was on your list.

07:38.874 --> 07:41.711
- Okay, how much?
- Uh, $200.

07:41.744 --> 07:44.513
It wasn't that expensive
last time.

07:44.545 --> 07:46.615
This one is more expensive.

07:47.716 --> 07:48.951
Well, I don't have that much.

07:50.786 --> 07:53.088
- How much do you have?
- 80.

07:53.122 --> 07:56.925
How about, um,
80 for the bottle?

07:56.959 --> 07:58.560
What am I gonna do with just
the bottle?

07:58.593 --> 08:01.163
I don't know,
fill it with Tic-Tacs.

08:04.266 --> 08:07.536
I can give you 50 for the
bottle.

08:07.569 --> 08:09.439
80. It has your name on it.

08:10.838 --> 08:12.108
Let me see.

08:12.141 --> 08:13.610
It's in the glove
compartment.

08:22.617 --> 08:24.687
Just dump the pills in the bag.

08:32.695 --> 08:34.897
You cool if I drop you here?

08:34.929 --> 08:37.399
Uh, no, I need something else.

08:37.432 --> 08:38.668
What?

08:42.604 --> 08:46.175
I need a copy of my
medical record.

08:46.207 --> 08:48.110
That's easy, you just
ask your doctor to...

08:48.143 --> 08:50.012
No, I need to make some
changes to it.

08:50.044 --> 08:52.514
Do you have the originals?

08:53.514 --> 08:54.750
No.

08:54.783 --> 08:56.951
You need them from scratch?

08:56.985 --> 08:58.921
Yeah, I need ones made.

08:58.953 --> 09:00.522
You need faked medical records.

09:01.623 --> 09:02.892
Yeah...

09:04.893 --> 09:06.696
Can you do that?

09:08.529 --> 09:10.533
Photoshop them or something.

09:10.566 --> 09:13.035
No, I need them to be authentic,
why can't you do it?

09:13.067 --> 09:14.502
I work in a lab.

09:14.535 --> 09:15.871
Fuck...

09:17.472 --> 09:19.007
Do you know someone who can?

09:20.008 --> 09:23.312
Maybe. I have this old roommate.

09:23.345 --> 09:24.814
He was a year ahead of me.

09:24.846 --> 09:27.149
He's got things for me in the
past, but...

09:27.182 --> 09:28.850
Um, I don't know about this.

09:29.851 --> 09:32.221
You'll ask him?

09:32.254 --> 09:35.224
I might be able to talk him into
it if you can guarantee

09:35.256 --> 09:36.491
a thousand or two.

09:36.524 --> 09:38.860
I can get a thousand.

09:38.894 --> 09:41.129
I mean, two thousand
would be better.

09:41.163 --> 09:43.666
He sends money home to his mom,
she's paralyzed or something.

09:43.698 --> 09:45.067
I don't know, she's expensive.
So I can try and play...

09:45.100 --> 09:47.736
I can only do a thousand.

09:47.769 --> 09:50.706
Well, I mean, let me
talk to him.

09:50.739 --> 09:54.009
I wrote down some details about
my diagnosis.

09:55.009 --> 09:56.379
Okay.

10:00.548 --> 10:04.019
You know, he's, um, he's gonna
have to know your name, right?

10:05.019 --> 10:06.588
- Yeah.
- All right.

11:22.965 --> 11:24.500
<i>Hey, sweetheart.</i>

11:24.533 --> 11:25.967
Hey, how are you doing?

11:26.000 --> 11:27.602
<i>Good.</i>

11:27.635 --> 11:29.971
Veronica said the tickets are
selling really well.

11:30.004 --> 11:31.974
<i>Yeah, she was texting me.</i>

11:32.006 --> 11:35.844
Awesome. How's, uh... how is
studying going?

11:35.878 --> 11:38.113
<i>I don't want to talk
about it.</i>

11:38.145 --> 11:40.115
<i>Do you want to come over for
a study break?</i>

11:40.148 --> 11:42.749
Yeah, I'd love that. I'll see
you soon.

11:42.783 --> 11:44.019
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

12:14.349 --> 12:16.118
Can you talk to Veronica

12:16.150 --> 12:18.887
about not having the View
article on the table?

12:20.889 --> 12:23.292
You're the front page.

12:23.325 --> 12:25.326
I know, but she misquoted
me a bunch,

12:25.360 --> 12:26.794
and I sound like a dumbass.

12:26.827 --> 12:28.530
You don't sound like a dumbass.

12:30.097 --> 12:31.900
Well, I don't sound smart.

12:32.900 --> 12:34.669
It's a great picture of you.

12:36.672 --> 12:38.206
It's an okay picture of me.

12:47.783 --> 12:50.353
I'll tell her to keep it
off the table.

12:52.921 --> 12:54.456
Thank you.

12:57.625 --> 12:59.895
I just don't want to seem like a
bitch, you know.

13:01.529 --> 13:03.899
There's really nothing wrong
with the article.

13:07.903 --> 13:11.606
Did you find a dress for the
fundraiser? Yeah?

13:11.639 --> 13:13.875
Yeah, I got one on Saturday.

13:13.908 --> 13:15.110
Can I see it?

13:15.143 --> 13:16.579
It's in there.

13:53.115 --> 13:54.383
Looks good, right?

13:54.416 --> 13:55.651
Yeah.

13:56.918 --> 13:58.620
I think it's beautiful.

13:58.653 --> 14:00.088
You can wear it on Friday.

14:01.856 --> 14:03.091
What?

14:03.125 --> 14:05.159
If you like it, wear it.

14:05.192 --> 14:06.495
Well, what would you wear?

14:06.528 --> 14:08.563
I'll find something else.

14:08.596 --> 14:10.265
Try it with the heels in there.

14:16.270 --> 14:18.439
Oh, shit! We got a donation!

14:18.472 --> 14:19.807
How much?

14:19.841 --> 14:21.243
A hundred!

14:21.275 --> 14:23.245
From May and Ken Parsons.

14:23.278 --> 14:26.815
2,545 now.

14:26.847 --> 14:28.082
Do you know them?

14:28.115 --> 14:29.518
I don't think so.

14:32.953 --> 14:34.856
Your Seattle appointment is
really soon.

14:35.990 --> 14:37.759
What do you mean?

14:37.793 --> 14:39.861
There's only 12 days left, I'm
worried we won't make the goal.

14:39.894 --> 14:41.263
We'll make it.

14:41.296 --> 14:43.299
You're going no matter what.

14:44.966 --> 14:46.402
I'm not taking money from you.

14:48.003 --> 14:49.705
It's the same as last time.

14:49.738 --> 14:52.708
We got the majority of our money
at the start and at the end.

14:55.143 --> 14:56.845
Somebody named Owen.

14:56.878 --> 14:58.714
Oh, yeah, thank you.

15:03.818 --> 15:05.120
Hey.

15:05.153 --> 15:06.656
<i>Hey, I talked to my buddy.</i>

15:07.822 --> 15:09.024
Okay.

15:09.057 --> 15:10.325
<i>He'll do it.</i>

15:10.357 --> 15:13.161
Okay, when do I meet you?

15:13.195 --> 15:14.629
<i>No, you're gonna have to meet
with him.</i>

15:14.663 --> 15:16.798
Why do I have to meet with him?

15:16.831 --> 15:18.966
<i>I don't know, it's a pretty
complicated thing to do.</i>

15:19.000 --> 15:22.904
<i>He said he could meet tomorrow
at noon.</i>

15:22.937 --> 15:24.206
Yeah, okay.

15:30.544 --> 15:32.480
<i>His name is Jabari.</i>

15:32.514 --> 15:33.849
What's his last name?

15:33.881 --> 15:35.250
<i>Why do you need it?
Just meet him.</i>

15:35.283 --> 15:36.918
I should know in case something
goes wrong.

15:36.951 --> 15:39.321
<i>Whatever, it's Jordan. Jabari
Jordan.</i>

15:39.354 --> 15:40.723
<i>You can meet him by the
reception.</i>

15:56.037 --> 15:57.506
I mocked up the banners.

15:57.538 --> 15:58.740
What?

15:58.774 --> 16:01.275
For the fundraiser.

16:01.308 --> 16:04.346
I want to see those.
Just let me get this off.

16:04.379 --> 16:06.414
Who was that?

16:06.447 --> 16:09.451
Oh, it was the
registrar's woman's assistant.

16:09.484 --> 16:11.320
I got the scholarship.

16:12.320 --> 16:14.355
Just now?

16:14.389 --> 16:17.426
No, she told me in our meeting
today.

16:17.458 --> 16:18.693
She said she really loves
everything

16:18.726 --> 16:19.927
that you and I are doing.

16:19.961 --> 16:22.297
Really? That's so good!

16:22.330 --> 16:25.600
Yeah, he just needed my SIN
number.

16:25.634 --> 16:27.936
Are you sure about the dress?

17:38.306 --> 17:40.375
Excuse me?

17:40.407 --> 17:44.478
Hello. Can I help you?

17:44.511 --> 17:46.315
- I, uh...
- Do you have an appointment?

17:46.347 --> 17:48.616
I'm...

17:48.650 --> 17:50.018
Sorry, can you give me a moment?

17:50.050 --> 17:52.420
I'm just... I'm meeting someone.

17:58.425 --> 18:00.328
I'm actually looking
for Dr. Jordan.

18:00.362 --> 18:01.563
Do you have an appointment?

18:01.596 --> 18:03.365
We were supposed
to meet here.

18:03.397 --> 18:04.632
I can check if he's in.

18:04.665 --> 18:05.867
Thank you.

18:05.901 --> 18:07.336
Just a moment.
What's your name?

18:07.368 --> 18:08.770
Maria Bennett.

18:13.340 --> 18:16.277
Yes, I have a Maria Bennett here
for Dr. Jordan.

18:18.212 --> 18:19.447
No.

18:20.448 --> 18:21.750
Okay.

18:23.183 --> 18:26.153
I'm sorry, Dr. Jordan is not
available.

18:26.186 --> 18:28.223
Okay, um, thank you.

18:57.585 --> 18:58.988
Jabari?

19:01.256 --> 19:04.326
I'm a friend of Owen's.
Can we talk?

19:14.001 --> 19:17.204
Was that... was that you who
asked me for at reception?

19:17.238 --> 19:19.374
I was waiting, and
you didn't show.

19:19.406 --> 19:21.242
You shouldn't have
asked for me by name.

19:21.276 --> 19:22.744
I had no choice.

19:22.777 --> 19:24.413
Owen said you'd
meet me at noon.

19:24.445 --> 19:27.115
I got pulled into a meeting.

19:27.147 --> 19:29.384
This won't take a lot of
your time. Owen said...

19:29.416 --> 19:32.820
Owen shouldn't have
spoken for me.

19:32.854 --> 19:36.223
Okay. I'm sorry.

19:36.257 --> 19:37.759
I didn't mean to
freak you out.

19:37.791 --> 19:39.260
This will be quick.

19:40.260 --> 19:42.396
Your name's Maria?

19:42.430 --> 19:45.267
Katherine. Katie.

19:45.299 --> 19:47.134
Reception said your
name was Maria.

19:47.167 --> 19:48.402
That's what I told her.

19:48.435 --> 19:49.871
You don't need...

19:51.472 --> 19:53.808
Look, Katherine, I'm, uh...

19:53.842 --> 19:58.280
I'm not gonna do this for you.

19:58.313 --> 20:00.148
Owen said you've
done this before.

20:00.181 --> 20:02.084
Owen said that I forged
medical documents?

20:02.116 --> 20:04.251
He said...

20:04.285 --> 20:05.687
He said that you'd help me.

20:05.720 --> 20:08.690
Well, he shouldn't
have said that.

20:08.722 --> 20:10.591
I looked you up online.

20:10.625 --> 20:12.126
And I saw your fundraising page.

20:12.160 --> 20:15.130
And... I don't want to
know what you're doing.

20:15.163 --> 20:16.698
I don't want to
be a part of it.

20:16.730 --> 20:19.335
So you can tell that to
Owen, and leave me alone.

20:24.338 --> 20:27.475
Owen said that you send
money home to your mom.

20:29.477 --> 20:31.880
I'll give $1,000
if you do this.

20:32.881 --> 20:34.682
I'm not doing anything wrong.

20:49.696 --> 20:50.932
$3,000.

20:51.932 --> 20:53.167
I don't have that much.

20:53.201 --> 20:56.371
Well... I don't do less.
You understand?

20:56.403 --> 20:59.641
It's not worth the risk to me
for any less.

20:59.673 --> 21:03.511
I could lose my licence, I could
get thrown out of my program.

21:03.545 --> 21:07.082
And... I know about you now.

21:12.252 --> 21:13.554
Okay.

21:15.123 --> 21:16.792
$2,000.

22:15.182 --> 22:16.617
Thanks.

22:45.313 --> 22:46.548
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:53.354 --> 22:54.956
Hey...

23:02.630 --> 23:05.433
You haven't seen the place
in awhile.

23:05.465 --> 23:07.835
Yeah, it's still blue.

23:09.403 --> 23:11.439
We're paving a drag strip

23:11.471 --> 23:13.708
on the west side of the oval in
November.

23:13.740 --> 23:15.576
That's great, Dad.

23:19.580 --> 23:24.519
Oh, you know, I saw... I saw this
really cool video

23:24.551 --> 23:27.788
someone put up on Facebook of
you dancing.

23:27.821 --> 23:31.492
Oh, yeah! Yeah, Jennifer
put that up.

23:31.526 --> 23:33.961
Jennifer is a friend?

23:33.994 --> 23:36.130
She's my girlfriend.

23:36.163 --> 23:38.200
Ah, right.

23:43.203 --> 23:45.740
So you're...
you're good to dance?

23:45.772 --> 23:49.577
I mean, it doesn't hurt or
something?

23:49.611 --> 23:52.514
Yeah, no. I mean, I get tired
faster,

23:52.547 --> 23:55.983
but my teachers look out for me.

23:56.017 --> 24:00.422
We're doing another show on
Friday, it's a fundraiser.

24:00.454 --> 24:03.692
So it's like a... for charity,
or for you?

24:03.724 --> 24:06.594
Uh, well, both.

24:06.627 --> 24:08.262
We haven't partnered with
anyone yet,

24:08.296 --> 24:10.365
but Jennifer is thinking we
could donate a portion

24:10.397 --> 24:12.099
if we do really good.

24:13.101 --> 24:14.603
So you're still...

24:15.737 --> 24:17.739
You're not getting any better?

24:21.142 --> 24:22.411
No.

24:24.645 --> 24:29.517
Uh, but that's... that's why
I'm here.

24:29.549 --> 24:32.320
I, uh, there's...

24:34.321 --> 24:36.890
I found a place that
can help me.

24:36.923 --> 24:38.160
Oh, yeah?

24:39.160 --> 24:41.463
But it's really expensive.

24:41.496 --> 24:44.566
Doesn't OHIP cover that?

24:44.598 --> 24:46.701
Well, I'm trying this
new experimental treatment

24:46.733 --> 24:48.202
in Seattle.

24:48.236 --> 24:51.605
I'm in a test group, and they
scheduled me in,

24:51.638 --> 24:54.508
but it's really expensive,
'cause it's in the States.

24:56.109 --> 24:58.078
How'd you find the place?

24:58.112 --> 25:01.548
Jennifer's parents give to a
bunch of charities,

25:01.582 --> 25:03.818
and they put me in touch
with someone,

25:03.851 --> 25:06.788
or hooked me up with a
team there.

25:06.820 --> 25:10.291
They're trying this new
treatment called immunotherapy.

25:12.859 --> 25:16.163
So why are you coming to me?

25:16.196 --> 25:18.465
They can't pay for it?

25:18.499 --> 25:21.935
Uh, I mean, they've already done
so much for me.

25:21.969 --> 25:24.673
I don't want to ask them
for more.

25:27.674 --> 25:29.810
When is it?

25:29.844 --> 25:31.480
It's, uh, January.

25:35.048 --> 25:37.117
How much do you need?

25:37.151 --> 25:40.154
It's $2,000, but OHIP won't
cover it.

25:43.657 --> 25:46.627
That's not so much for that kind
of thing.

25:46.661 --> 25:50.030
It's to cover the consultation,
and flights,

25:50.064 --> 25:53.034
and hotels and stuff. I'd have
to go back down again

25:53.067 --> 25:54.635
for the actual treatment if I
qualify.

25:54.669 --> 25:57.706
I'm not looking for a handout,
there's bursaries

25:57.739 --> 25:59.473
for students like me, so...

25:59.507 --> 26:02.677
Bursaries, like a scholarship?

26:02.710 --> 26:05.046
So... are you working?

26:05.078 --> 26:06.947
Do you still have a job?
I mean...

26:06.980 --> 26:11.853
No, I had to quit right before
my first round of chemo.

26:14.855 --> 26:18.727
The deadline is Friday and I can
pay you back then.

26:18.759 --> 26:19.993
How much is it?

26:20.027 --> 26:22.931
It's $2,000, Dad.

26:24.932 --> 26:26.968
Can I ask you something?

26:27.000 --> 26:29.237
Uh, you're not going to like
this, but I want to know

26:29.269 --> 26:33.775
if you're in some kind of
trouble, like you were before.

26:35.777 --> 26:37.711
What?

26:37.744 --> 26:39.179
I know I'm not always so good

26:39.212 --> 26:41.450
at knowing how to handle
these things, but...

26:44.285 --> 26:46.621
I don't think money is the way
to help you.

26:49.624 --> 26:54.363
I'm not well, and this place
could actually save me.

26:56.364 --> 26:59.867
I wouldn't be here asking you if
it wasn't really important.

26:59.901 --> 27:03.738
Here's the thing. Susan and I
remortgaged the place.

27:03.770 --> 27:05.940
And we consolidated our debt,

27:05.972 --> 27:08.542
which we've been meaning to do
for a really long time,

27:08.576 --> 27:12.913
so... no, I can't loan you the
money.

27:12.946 --> 27:15.783
And frankly, I'm not sure I
would if I had it.

27:18.786 --> 27:20.255
What do you mean?

27:28.261 --> 27:29.498
I don't believe you.

27:35.502 --> 27:37.004
Okay...

27:39.006 --> 27:40.909
We don't have to do this again.

27:40.942 --> 27:43.278
I'm just asking you for
something simple.

27:43.310 --> 27:45.245
And you're calling me a liar,
so...

27:45.278 --> 27:46.948
I don't think you have cancer.

27:46.980 --> 27:48.249
Of course I do.

27:48.281 --> 27:49.583
Do you realize what you're
saying?

27:49.616 --> 27:51.051
Yeah, I really do.

27:51.085 --> 27:54.087
Jesus, what the fuck is wrong
with you?

27:54.121 --> 27:58.660
What the fuck is wrong
with you?!

28:01.761 --> 28:04.631
You are such a fucking loser,
you know that?

28:04.664 --> 28:06.968
I know you don't have cancer
and you're lying,

28:07.000 --> 28:08.502
just like in high school.

28:12.105 --> 28:15.442
I'm sick, Dad.

28:15.476 --> 28:18.012
You should be one of the people
helping me fight,

28:18.045 --> 28:20.148
not making me worse!

28:20.181 --> 28:22.250
You're gonna have to tell
these people

28:22.282 --> 28:24.084
if you're taking
money from them.

28:24.117 --> 28:26.354
You're going to have to take all
that online stuff down.

28:26.386 --> 28:28.522
You are going to get into
trouble.

28:31.125 --> 28:33.694
I thought that you would feel
guilty enough about Mom

28:33.728 --> 28:35.663
that you wouldn't want to take
that chance again.

28:37.664 --> 28:41.435
You lying to Jessica too?

28:41.469 --> 28:43.572
- Who is Jessica?
- I mean Jennifer.

29:13.733 --> 29:15.702
Katie?

29:15.736 --> 29:18.173
Katie! You were asleep.

29:19.173 --> 29:20.807
Oh, sorry.

29:20.840 --> 29:22.676
Have you been
waiting long?

29:22.710 --> 29:25.813
No, I was just feeling a little
light-headed.

29:25.846 --> 29:28.182
Okay. Do you want to get
something?

29:28.214 --> 29:30.184
We can go somewhere else.

29:31.184 --> 29:32.753
Not hungry.

29:37.758 --> 29:40.061
Did you take your pills today?

29:40.094 --> 29:41.630
Oh, not yet.

29:44.230 --> 29:45.700
I'm happy you texted.

29:45.732 --> 29:47.935
I didn't think I was going
to see you today.

29:49.936 --> 29:51.605
- Is this them?
- Yeah.

29:52.606 --> 29:55.742
You don't look so bad.

29:55.776 --> 29:58.278
Chemo was this morning, right?

29:58.311 --> 29:59.913
I know you said you don't want
me there,

29:59.946 --> 30:02.316
but I have decided that I should
start coming with you.

30:11.325 --> 30:13.260
They wouldn't let me.

30:13.294 --> 30:15.897
What do you mean?

30:15.930 --> 30:17.932
My red blood cells are
too low, so...

30:17.964 --> 30:20.134
they pushed my session
to next week.

30:22.135 --> 30:24.439
Is that a bad thing?

30:24.471 --> 30:26.974
Well, I had to do an MRI.

30:27.008 --> 30:31.645
I had a seizure, or at least
they think I did.

30:31.679 --> 30:34.415
- What? When?
- Last week, I think.

30:34.448 --> 30:35.850
I was at home.

30:37.852 --> 30:40.288
I've been throwing up every
morning.

30:41.689 --> 30:44.526
Isn't that because of the chemo?

30:46.926 --> 30:49.163
It's hard to say.

30:49.195 --> 30:51.198
How would you not know that?

30:56.202 --> 30:59.840
They think the melanoma may have
metastasized to my brain.

31:01.842 --> 31:04.846
They don't know for sure,

31:04.878 --> 31:07.348
but they said they'd have
the results tomorrow.

31:10.284 --> 31:11.486
I need to call my Mum.

31:11.519 --> 31:12.953
No, please don't.

31:12.987 --> 31:14.355
Seattle can move up my
appointment

31:14.387 --> 31:15.923
if the results are bad.

31:15.955 --> 31:19.159
God, I wish I was there.

31:19.192 --> 31:21.095
I don't have the money yet, Jen.

31:21.127 --> 31:24.499
That's fine. I'll transfer it to
you. How much do you need?

31:24.531 --> 31:28.336
$2,000 for the flight and two
night's stay.

31:28.368 --> 31:32.105
Okay, are you sure that's
enough?

31:32.138 --> 31:33.607
I'll pay you back, I promise.

31:33.641 --> 31:36.544
I'll send it right now.

31:36.576 --> 31:40.714
I need cash, actually. My debit
is overdrawn,

31:40.748 --> 31:42.049
and so anything that goes into
the account

31:42.083 --> 31:44.219
will just pay off the balance.

31:47.755 --> 31:48.990
Okay.

32:00.734 --> 32:03.203
I have a fucking withdrawal
limit of $500 a day.

32:03.237 --> 32:04.706
Can you call them?

32:04.739 --> 32:05.972
See if they'll let you take
out the rest?

32:06.006 --> 32:07.208
Yeah, sure.

32:07.240 --> 32:08.475
Thanks.

32:22.256 --> 32:25.526
Yeah, it's 2459...

32:25.558 --> 32:28.829
9017...

32:28.863 --> 32:31.865
8890... 2425.

32:35.236 --> 32:37.038
Jennifer Ellis.

32:40.039 --> 32:43.545
Uh, yeah, it's July 7th, 1994.

32:46.547 --> 32:49.283
Thank you, yeah. I need to take
out $2,000 today,

32:49.316 --> 32:51.285
and the machine is telling me
that I have a withdrawal limit

32:51.317 --> 32:53.287
of $500 a day,

32:53.319 --> 32:56.957
and so I would like to
temporarily lift that.

33:00.961 --> 33:05.066
No, I understand, I just need to
up it for right now.

33:05.098 --> 33:06.567
Okay, sure.

33:09.135 --> 33:10.704
Okay, thank you.

33:10.738 --> 33:12.440
We need to find a bank.

33:40.433 --> 33:41.635
Wouldn't it just be easier for
me to book you a ticket

33:41.669 --> 33:42.903
on my credit card?

33:42.936 --> 33:46.306
- Probably.
- Yeah, good.

33:46.339 --> 33:47.741
You wanna come to mine tonight?

33:47.775 --> 33:49.844
Yeah, but I want
to go home first.

33:49.876 --> 33:51.511
Sure.

33:51.545 --> 33:54.515
Okay, come over later and I'll
book you a ticket then.

33:54.548 --> 33:56.183
And I'm gonna tell my Mum
and Adam

33:56.217 --> 33:57.986
that you're not going to make
dinner tomorrow night.

33:59.987 --> 34:03.124
Kadisha actually already booked
me a ticket.

34:03.156 --> 34:04.958
I just need to pay her back.

34:05.960 --> 34:08.929
Why didn't you come to me first?

34:08.963 --> 34:13.000
I didn't mean... you're right,
I'm sorry.

34:13.032 --> 34:17.337
I was totally out of it, and
she was just there.

34:17.371 --> 34:21.008
I'm sorry. I know I'm not
handling this very well.

34:21.041 --> 34:25.646
So couldn't I just email Kadisha
the money, then?

34:25.679 --> 34:28.883
No, 'cause I already feel bad
about borrowing from her,

34:28.916 --> 34:30.151
and I don't really want
her to know

34:30.184 --> 34:33.120
that I borrowed from you
to pay her back.

34:33.152 --> 34:34.955
I know I made things really
complicated,

34:34.989 --> 34:37.257
but can we just take out the
money tomorrow?

34:38.692 --> 34:39.994
Yeah, okay.

35:03.550 --> 35:04.752
Your surname?

35:04.784 --> 35:06.587
Arneson.

35:08.588 --> 35:10.657
Given name.

35:10.690 --> 35:13.393
- Uh, Katherine.
- With a C or a K?

35:13.427 --> 35:14.896
With a K.

35:16.931 --> 35:18.164
Date of birth.

35:18.197 --> 35:20.067
March 2nd, 1995.

35:24.237 --> 35:27.942
I don't eat.

35:27.974 --> 35:30.610
Come on...

35:30.643 --> 35:33.413
Sex, female. Marital status,
single?

35:33.447 --> 35:34.682
I have a partner.

35:34.715 --> 35:35.917
Do you need to
know their name?

35:35.949 --> 35:38.618
- Are you married?
- No.

35:38.652 --> 35:40.621
Okay, you've got
married, widowed,

35:40.653 --> 35:42.956
separated, divorced,
single. You're single.

35:42.989 --> 35:44.224
Where were you born?

35:44.257 --> 35:46.226
Flamborough.

35:48.228 --> 35:50.097
- Occupation?
- Student.

35:51.931 --> 35:54.234
- Nationality?
- Canadian.

35:56.070 --> 35:57.271
Address.

35:57.304 --> 36:01.608
732 Gibson Ave, Hamilton,
Ontario.

36:01.641 --> 36:03.510
L8L 6K4.

36:07.481 --> 36:08.716
Cool.

36:08.748 --> 36:10.317
What do people think you have?

36:10.351 --> 36:12.119
Cancer.

36:12.152 --> 36:13.753
Yeah, I mean, what kind?

36:13.786 --> 36:15.489
Melanoma.

36:15.521 --> 36:18.759
Okay. When were you diagnosed?

36:18.791 --> 36:21.228
I'm saying about ten months ago.

36:21.260 --> 36:22.896
Ten months ago you told people?

36:22.929 --> 36:26.567
Yeah, I'm saying I had it
removed in March,

36:26.599 --> 36:29.269
and then I've been in two rounds
of chemotherapy since then.

36:29.302 --> 36:32.639
And then I'm doing immunotherapy
in Seattle in January.

36:32.672 --> 36:34.641
You said you had the tumour
surgically removed?

36:34.675 --> 36:36.644
Yeah, I have a scar.

36:36.677 --> 36:38.112
What do you mean?

36:38.144 --> 36:42.016
I have a soccer scar from when I
was little.

36:42.048 --> 36:45.052
I tell people that's from when
they removed it.

36:47.653 --> 36:50.858
Okay.

36:50.891 --> 36:54.762
What type of melanoma do people
think you have?

36:54.795 --> 36:56.597
What type?

36:56.630 --> 36:58.833
There are different types.

36:58.865 --> 37:01.835
There's superficial spreading,

37:01.869 --> 37:03.938
nodular, lentigo malignant.

37:03.971 --> 37:07.041
- That's never been a thing.
- Okay.

37:07.074 --> 37:10.378
Just... make something up,
whatever you write

37:10.411 --> 37:12.012
is what I have.

37:17.650 --> 37:20.320
Okay, so you... you had a biopsy
in January,

37:20.353 --> 37:22.322
had it removed in March, and
you're what,

37:22.356 --> 37:24.191
saying you're in chemo now?

37:24.224 --> 37:25.793
Yeah.

37:25.826 --> 37:27.494
You're on your second round,
you've already done two?

37:27.527 --> 37:30.530
I'm doing it now. I've been
going once a week

37:30.563 --> 37:31.998
for three months now.

37:32.032 --> 37:33.867
No, no, that's not how...

37:33.900 --> 37:36.202
you probably wouldn't go that
frequently.

37:36.235 --> 37:38.304
It would probably make sense for
you to have something like

37:38.338 --> 37:41.307
one, maybe five days on,
followed by three weeks off.

37:41.340 --> 37:43.476
But no chemo regime is weekly.

37:43.510 --> 37:45.913
We won't find anyone with a
schedule like that.

37:45.945 --> 37:47.514
Everyone knows I go once a week.

37:47.547 --> 37:50.884
Well, that wouldn't make sense.

37:50.918 --> 37:53.220
We need test results and
doctor's notes,

37:53.253 --> 37:55.322
so we need to find someone with
a similar diagnosis

37:55.355 --> 37:56.958
and timeline.

38:39.800 --> 38:41.502
So I have 500 bucks.

38:46.507 --> 38:49.143
Are you kidding?

38:49.175 --> 38:52.947
The bank has a limit, the
machine has a withdrawal limit.

38:52.980 --> 38:54.615
I-I couldn't take
it all out today.

38:55.615 --> 38:56.851
And?

38:59.452 --> 39:01.422
And I could only
take out so much.

39:02.422 --> 39:05.458
You said you had $2,000.

39:05.492 --> 39:09.830
I'll... I'll, uh, I'll give you
this now,

39:09.862 --> 39:12.299
and I'll bring you the rest
tomorrow.

39:15.302 --> 39:17.171
I'll go to the bank as soon as
it opens,

39:17.204 --> 39:19.306
and I'll go to a teller, and
I'll get it.

39:19.338 --> 39:21.509
The bank was closed by the time
I got there,

39:21.541 --> 39:23.376
that's why I had to use a
machine.

39:26.947 --> 39:30.284
Okay, well... I'm gonna
take the $500.

39:31.351 --> 39:33.253
But I'm gonna keep the records

39:33.286 --> 39:36.856
until you give me the remaining
$1,500, if you can get it.

39:36.889 --> 39:40.793
I can. I already explained
that to you.

39:40.827 --> 39:42.830
I have the money.

39:42.862 --> 39:44.197
Please just let me take them

39:44.231 --> 39:46.467
and I promise I'll pay you
tomorrow.

39:47.467 --> 39:49.369
I start my shift at 11.

39:49.402 --> 39:50.871
Text me when you're here.

40:40.721 --> 40:42.590

Just go back to sleep.

42:25.192 --> 42:26.661
Now I'm awake.

42:53.085 --> 42:55.855
Hey. I'll pay you back
as soon as I can.

42:55.889 --> 42:57.458
Don't worry about
that right now.

42:57.490 --> 43:00.793
And I'll see you later for
dinner if I can make it.

43:00.827 --> 43:02.330
- Bye.
- Bye.

43:16.510 --> 43:20.414
<i>You have reached...
Jabari Jordan.</i>

43:20.447 --> 43:23.483
Jabari, it's Katie. I'm here
outside.

43:23.516 --> 43:27.020
I'm ready, I've got it. Call me
back, okay?

43:29.021 --> 43:31.257
Hey, Jabari.

43:31.291 --> 43:34.094
<i>Hey, it's Kadisha, we're all here.
Can you still do it?</i>

43:34.126 --> 43:37.697
Uh... sorry, um, I'm
running late.

43:37.731 --> 43:39.433
You guys should start rehearsing
without me.

43:39.465 --> 43:40.701
<i>All right, see you soon.</i>

43:40.733 --> 43:41.969
Okay.

43:54.780 --> 43:58.684
Hi, I have an appointment with
Dr. Jordan.

43:58.717 --> 44:01.721
Uh... can you hang on a moment?

44:04.557 --> 44:07.094
- What's your name?
- Katherine Arneson.

44:09.094 --> 44:11.297
Yeah, there's a Katherine
Arnson here.

44:11.331 --> 44:13.700
- Arneson.
- Katherine Arneson.

44:13.733 --> 44:18.105
She says she has an appointment
with Dr. Jordan.

44:18.137 --> 44:19.672
Uh-huh.

44:21.675 --> 44:23.110
Okay.

44:25.679 --> 44:27.581
Sure. Sure, I'll check.

44:29.583 --> 44:30.985
Just one moment.

44:47.967 --> 44:50.971
Sorry, we don't seem to have you
on his patient list.

44:51.003 --> 44:52.605
Sorry?

44:52.639 --> 44:53.841
Are you a new patient?

44:53.873 --> 44:55.741
Yes.

44:55.775 --> 44:57.811
Dr. Jordan's had to take a leave
of absence.

44:57.844 --> 45:00.813
We're transferring all of his
patients to other residents.

45:00.847 --> 45:02.249
What?

45:02.282 --> 45:04.251
Well, you said you had an
appointment?

45:04.284 --> 45:07.921
I, um, I must have gotten the
days mixed up.

45:07.954 --> 45:09.490
Well, let me just get your
information,

45:09.523 --> 45:10.791
and then we'll get you
reassigned and rescheduled

45:10.824 --> 45:12.159
- just as soon as possible.
- Is he okay?

45:12.192 --> 45:14.161
He had a family emergency.

45:14.193 --> 45:16.462
I think he caught a flight out
this morning.

45:16.496 --> 45:17.764
To where?

45:17.797 --> 45:19.699
I'm sorry, I can't
disclose that,

45:19.733 --> 45:21.702
but if you give me your
information...

45:21.735 --> 45:23.202
Yeah, sure, can you just
give me a moment?

45:23.235 --> 45:26.306
Sure.

45:30.342 --> 45:32.445
<i>You have reached...
Jabari Jordan.</i>

45:34.213 --> 45:37.717
Where are you? Answer your
phone, it's Katie. I'm here.

45:37.751 --> 45:41.955
You fucking asshole.
You fucked me.

45:41.987 --> 45:44.991
I'm here. I have the money.
Where are you?

45:46.726 --> 45:50.364
Fuck your family emergency!
I hate you! You're a liar.

45:50.396 --> 45:52.331
I hope your mother dies, you
worthless fuck.

45:52.364 --> 45:55.735
Miss Arneson, hi. I'm Dr. Platt.

45:55.768 --> 45:58.905
Mary tells me that you had an
appointment with Dr. Jordan?

45:58.938 --> 46:00.907
Oh, if now is a bad time
I can come back.

46:00.940 --> 46:03.042
Not at all, we're just
trying to sort a few things out.

46:03.076 --> 46:04.978
I'm one of Dr. Jordan's
supervisors.

46:05.010 --> 46:06.646
Would you come with me to my
office?

46:06.679 --> 46:08.915
Uh, you know what, I'm actually
just in a bit of a rush.

46:08.949 --> 46:10.684
Of course.

46:10.717 --> 46:12.920
Could you tell me about the
nature of your appointment?

46:12.952 --> 46:14.922
Uh...

46:14.954 --> 46:17.391
I'm sorry to ask such
an indelicate question,

46:17.423 --> 46:19.259
it's just that Dr. Jordan won't
be seeing his patients

46:19.291 --> 46:21.761
for a while, and we're trying to
sort out what we missed.

46:21.795 --> 46:23.530
Where is he?

46:23.563 --> 46:26.666
He's gone home. His mother
passed away early this morning,

46:26.699 --> 46:28.935
and he's taking a
leave of absence.

46:28.969 --> 46:30.704
We're giving him as
much time as he needs.

46:30.737 --> 46:33.407
I'm sure you understand.

46:33.440 --> 46:34.675
You know what?

46:34.708 --> 46:35.943
I'm gonna get you
to leave your name

46:35.976 --> 46:37.544
with Mary at the front desk,

46:37.577 --> 46:39.112
and we're going to have her
reschedule your appointment

46:39.144 --> 46:41.014
as soon as possible with
another member of your team.

46:41.047 --> 46:42.650
I was just picking something up.

46:43.650 --> 46:45.918
Sorry?

46:45.952 --> 46:47.721
There's an envelope with my
medical records in it

46:47.753 --> 46:50.123
that Dr. Jordan had for me, I
was just picking that up.

46:50.155 --> 46:52.393
Oh, I could check that for you.
Come with me.

46:58.731 --> 47:00.032
Just wait here one moment.

47:00.065 --> 47:01.334
Okay.

47:21.353 --> 47:23.556
Found it! I just need to see a
piece of ID.

47:23.590 --> 47:24.825
Of course.

47:37.269 --> 47:39.905
Great. Just confirm your
information with Mary,

47:39.938 --> 47:41.974
and we'll get you in to see
someone as soon as possible.

47:42.007 --> 47:43.242
- Okay.
- All right.

47:43.275 --> 47:44.677
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

47:59.958 --> 48:03.295
Hi, this is for Miss Stansfield.

48:03.329 --> 48:05.798
Yeah, she's actually across
campus in a meeting,

48:05.831 --> 48:07.333
but you can leave it with me,
and I'll see she gets it.

48:07.367 --> 48:09.503
She said I needed to mail it by
the end of today.

48:09.536 --> 48:11.972
Oh, yeah. You're right, she left
me instructions

48:12.005 --> 48:14.508
- on where to send it.
- Okay.

48:14.541 --> 48:15.842
And you have two copies in here?

48:15.875 --> 48:17.309
Uh, no, just the one.

48:17.342 --> 48:19.111
There aren't duplicates in here?

48:19.144 --> 48:22.048
No, just one. Is that a problem.

48:22.081 --> 48:23.315
Okay, we're gonna need
duplicates.

49:29.248 --> 49:30.449
Hello!

49:30.483 --> 49:31.885
- Oh, hi, Katie!
- Hi!

49:31.918 --> 49:33.120
Shanah Tovah!

49:33.152 --> 49:34.386
Look at that!

49:34.420 --> 49:36.456
Sha-nah To-vah!
Sorry.

49:36.489 --> 49:38.391
- Hi, Katie.
- Hi!

49:38.423 --> 49:39.626
How are you doing?

49:39.659 --> 49:41.695
I'm great, I'm really great.

49:41.728 --> 49:43.130
Katie, this is my brother, Sam.

49:43.163 --> 49:44.697
- Hi!
- Hi, Katie.

49:44.731 --> 49:46.299
Great to finally meet you.

49:46.331 --> 49:47.567
Yeah, so nice to meet you, too.

49:47.599 --> 49:48.802
And this is Isaac.

49:48.835 --> 49:50.070
Hi, Isaac!

49:50.103 --> 49:51.371
Hi.

49:51.403 --> 49:53.239
Nice to meet
you, I'm Katie.

49:53.273 --> 49:54.908
What you building?

49:54.940 --> 49:58.511
A staircase that goes up and
then back down.

50:00.112 --> 50:01.614
Cute.

50:03.615 --> 50:07.788
So I got my test results today.

50:07.820 --> 50:10.156
And?

50:10.190 --> 50:13.092
They were negative. They didn't
find anything wrong.

50:13.126 --> 50:14.428
Oh my God.

50:18.431 --> 50:20.400
But what about the seizure?

50:20.432 --> 50:24.137
Uh, they don't know about that
yet, but they think it's fine.

50:24.170 --> 50:26.005
I'm so relieved.

50:26.039 --> 50:28.175
I've been stressing all day, you
have no idea.

50:28.208 --> 50:30.943
I've been feeling so much better
today.

50:30.976 --> 50:35.080
I was really down all week, and
I didn't tell you...

50:35.114 --> 50:38.952
but I actually think... I'm
gonna win this.

50:41.855 --> 50:43.356
Come here.

50:47.960 --> 50:49.929
Guys, we got some amazing news
tonight.

50:49.963 --> 50:52.833
We are destroying this cancer
with all of you.

50:52.865 --> 50:54.534
See you Friday.

50:58.538 --> 51:00.773
Jennifer said you
guys have been fasting?

51:00.806 --> 51:02.274
It's just Sam and me.

51:02.307 --> 51:04.177
Yeah,
Isaac's a bit too little for that.

51:04.210 --> 51:05.878
Right, and Jennifer
doesn't do it either, yeah?

51:05.911 --> 51:07.313
No, Nola and Jennifer don't.

51:07.347 --> 51:08.882
Why?

51:08.914 --> 51:10.282
Well, we do some of the Jewish
things with them,

51:10.315 --> 51:13.052
but fasting is too much for me.

51:13.085 --> 51:14.453
Yeah, why do you do it?

51:14.487 --> 51:16.189
It's the day of atonement.

51:16.222 --> 51:18.158
In the days leading
up to Rosh Hashanah,

51:18.190 --> 51:21.894
God inscribes all of our names
into the book of life.

51:21.927 --> 51:26.031
On Yom Kippur, these judgements
are sealed,

51:26.065 --> 51:28.835
so this day is kinda like, um,
it's like a last appeal,

51:28.867 --> 51:31.203
like a last chance to change
that judgement,

51:31.237 --> 51:33.740
to demonstrate your repentance
and make amends.

51:33.773 --> 51:35.876
Come here, hey, do you want to
give him the...

51:35.909 --> 51:38.010
Oh yeah, Sam, I brought a
present for Isaac.

51:38.043 --> 51:40.012
- Is it okay if I...
- Of course!

51:40.045 --> 51:41.547
It's just right behind you, can
you grab it?

51:41.581 --> 51:42.849
- Sure, yeah.
- Thanks.

51:44.918 --> 51:46.820
- Exciting!
- Here you go.

51:46.853 --> 51:48.221
Are you going
to open it?

51:48.253 --> 51:50.891
Come on, rip it open!

51:51.891 --> 51:54.760
Yeah! Do you want some help?

51:56.762 --> 51:58.664
Oh, it's a book!

51:58.697 --> 52:00.733
Yeah,
I heard you like dinosaurs,

52:00.766 --> 52:02.701
so it's about a panda and
a parrot

52:02.735 --> 52:04.604
who see dinosaurs in the clouds.

52:04.637 --> 52:07.507
Wow!
He's even holding a dinosaur!

52:07.539 --> 52:09.175
Mm-hm! That looks fun!

52:09.208 --> 52:10.577
What do you say, Isaac?

52:10.610 --> 52:12.579
- Thank you!
- You're welcome, buddy.

52:12.612 --> 52:13.847
Maybe Katie will read
it with you after dinner.

52:13.880 --> 52:15.682
I'd love to.

52:15.715 --> 52:16.917
Oh, Jennifer,
can you just help me in the kitchen?

52:16.949 --> 52:18.183
Okay.

52:18.217 --> 52:19.419
Do you need any help?

52:19.452 --> 52:20.687
No, it's okay.

52:20.719 --> 52:22.054
Sorry, love.

52:22.088 --> 52:24.457
That's pretty cool, huh?

52:24.489 --> 52:25.791
Oh!

52:25.824 --> 52:27.393
Hey, where are you going?

52:27.427 --> 52:31.597
Here, Isaac, Isaac, Isaac! Take
a seat here.

52:31.630 --> 52:33.900
We'll look at this for a second.

52:36.302 --> 52:38.038
Oh, this looks like a great
book!

52:38.070 --> 52:39.940
Yeah, I really like the artwork.

52:39.972 --> 52:41.907
Hey, Isaac?

52:41.940 --> 52:43.809
What's your... what's your
favourite dinosaur?

52:43.842 --> 52:47.146
Um... brontosaurus, probably.

52:47.179 --> 52:49.315
Mm, they are pretty cool!

52:52.085 --> 52:55.588
Maybe it's an eagle but
they didn't have the right paint

52:55.621 --> 52:58.490
so they just painted an orange?

52:58.523 --> 52:59.792
That looks like a boot.

52:59.826 --> 53:01.260
Excuse me.

53:45.737 --> 53:48.774
<i>You have reached...
Doug Arneson.</i>

53:48.807 --> 53:50.643
<i>Please leave your message
after the...</i>

54:31.349 --> 54:34.086
Hey... want to read your book?

54:34.119 --> 54:35.554
Okay.

54:35.588 --> 54:37.524
Let's go back to the beginning.

54:41.594 --> 54:44.597
Is that it? Yeah. Okay.

54:46.865 --> 54:50.570
Panda loved to draw, dance, and
play music.

54:50.603 --> 54:52.438
See him there?

54:52.472 --> 54:55.876
Panda enjoyed reading, building,
and solving puzzles.

54:59.878 --> 55:03.415
One day, Panda wanted to dance,
and Parrot wanted to

55:03.449 --> 55:05.684
put the finishing touches
on a castle.

55:05.717 --> 55:08.288
But parrot couldn't concentrate
with Panda's loud music,

55:08.320 --> 55:11.290
and Panda got bored of
dancing alone.

55:11.324 --> 55:13.726
Hey, you guys.
We're going to wash up, okay, Isaac?

55:13.759 --> 55:15.929
- Okay.
- Almost time to eat!

55:15.961 --> 55:17.262
Finish the book after
dinner, okay?

55:17.295 --> 55:18.530
Yeah.

55:18.563 --> 55:20.067
Come on. Come on, buddy.

55:30.076 --> 55:31.610
You okay?

55:32.945 --> 55:34.414
What's wrong?

55:34.447 --> 55:37.584
Um, I think I'm just gonna go.

55:37.617 --> 55:38.885
Are you feeling okay?

55:38.918 --> 55:41.320
Yeah, I'm... I'm just gonna
go home.

55:41.353 --> 55:43.755
Do you want to go to my place?
I can come with you.

55:43.789 --> 55:47.160
I'm really sorry, I think I
just...

55:47.193 --> 55:48.595
pushed myself too hard,

55:48.628 --> 55:50.263
and I'm gonna go back to my
apartment

55:50.295 --> 55:51.498
and go straight to bed.

55:51.530 --> 55:53.398
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

55:53.431 --> 55:55.467
Okay, sure.

55:55.501 --> 55:57.903
Do you love me?

55:57.936 --> 55:59.438
Yes.

56:00.438 --> 56:02.341
Guys, Katie's gonna head.

56:02.375 --> 56:03.610
Thank you so much for having me.

56:03.643 --> 56:05.144
Oh no, is everything all right?

56:05.177 --> 56:06.778
Oh, she just has an early
rehearsal tomorrow.

56:06.811 --> 56:10.150
I just, um, I pushed myself too
much, but I'm fine.

56:10.182 --> 56:12.152
Really, I just need a good
night's sleep.

56:12.184 --> 56:14.820
I haven't really been...

56:14.853 --> 56:18.157
Well, I'm so glad that you could
drop by for a bit.

56:18.190 --> 56:19.625
But we'll see you Friday night,
right?

56:19.659 --> 56:20.860
For sure.

56:20.893 --> 56:22.628
Can I drive you home?

56:22.661 --> 56:24.663
Oh, no, that's very kind, but
I'll just get going, okay?

56:24.697 --> 56:26.699
Oh, I'm sorry. It was great
meeting you.

56:26.731 --> 56:29.768
Yeah, you as well. Nice meeting
you, Isaac.

56:29.802 --> 56:32.204
Can we give you
some food to take home?

56:32.237 --> 56:34.806
- No, I-I'm okay.
- Are you sure?

56:34.840 --> 56:37.110
Yeah, no thank you, I'm fine.

56:37.143 --> 56:38.778
Have a good night.

56:38.811 --> 56:42.182
I hope rehearsal goes well, and
we will see you Friday.

56:42.215 --> 56:43.449
Good night, Katie.

56:43.481 --> 56:44.684
Bye!

56:44.717 --> 56:46.019
Bye.

56:50.021 --> 56:51.657
Okay, well,
there's still a lot of food...

56:56.228 --> 56:57.963
Call me if you need anything.

56:57.996 --> 56:59.699
Yeah, I will. Okay.

57:18.016 --> 57:21.053
Please take it down.

57:21.086 --> 57:23.222
<i>No.</i>

57:23.255 --> 57:26.091
Please, Dad...

57:27.960 --> 57:30.362
I hated my life before I got
cancer.

57:33.365 --> 57:35.835
<i>I asked you to do
something about this.</i>

57:37.536 --> 57:40.440
Then let me do it my way.

57:40.472 --> 57:43.942
Please....

57:43.976 --> 57:46.012
I can get better.

57:46.045 --> 57:49.349
<i>Come home and stay
with me and Susan for awhile.</i>

57:49.382 --> 57:51.050
<i>I know someone who knows
a lawyer,</i>

57:51.083 --> 57:52.851
<i>and I think you should
talk to him.</i>

57:52.885 --> 57:56.256
No, you're not listening
to me.

57:56.289 --> 57:59.192
I know a better way to end this.

57:59.224 --> 58:01.427
<i>No.
It's too late for that, Katie.</i>

59:11.463 --> 59:13.333
Hi.

59:13.365 --> 59:15.867
Katie,
what the hell is going on?

59:15.900 --> 59:17.703
You saw the post?

59:17.737 --> 59:20.206
Are you all right?

59:20.239 --> 59:21.773
I'm okay.

59:21.806 --> 59:24.209
It's not true, right?

59:26.811 --> 59:28.213
Of course not.

59:30.215 --> 59:32.051
All right, come.

59:36.222 --> 59:37.824
Why would he post that?

59:37.856 --> 59:40.393
I guess he believes it.

59:40.425 --> 59:42.728
He has this, like, disorder.

59:42.762 --> 59:45.198
Delusional something or other.

59:45.231 --> 59:46.966
I haven't spoken to him since
first year,

59:46.998 --> 59:49.301
but he wanted to come to one of
my appointments a few weeks ago

59:49.335 --> 59:52.137
and he just ended up asking me
for money.

59:52.170 --> 59:54.973
And he threatened to...

59:55.007 --> 59:58.811
he accused me of a bunch of
shit, it was scary.

59:58.844 --> 01:00:00.079
Wow.

01:00:01.847 --> 01:00:03.750
Is your mom home?

01:00:03.782 --> 01:00:06.918
Uh, yeah, she's just working,
but I can...

01:00:06.952 --> 01:00:08.588
Can I talk to her?

01:00:08.621 --> 01:00:10.021
I just wanna do something
quickly,

01:00:10.054 --> 01:00:11.990
I think I should sue him for
defamation.

01:00:12.023 --> 01:00:14.192
Okay, yeah.

01:00:14.226 --> 01:00:16.496
Um... I'll go get her.

01:00:16.528 --> 01:00:21.032
Well, I told her everything that
was going on, so she knows,

01:00:21.065 --> 01:00:23.502
but I'm sure she'll do anything
she can to help.

01:00:23.536 --> 01:00:24.836
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:00:24.869 --> 01:00:26.072
Okay, I'll be right back.

01:00:26.105 --> 01:00:28.407
- Thank you.
- Okay.

01:00:41.887 --> 01:00:43.356
Hi, Katie.

01:00:43.389 --> 01:00:45.258
Hi!

01:00:45.291 --> 01:00:47.559
I'm sorry to hear what's
happened.

01:00:47.592 --> 01:00:49.694
Thank you for your donation
the other day.

01:00:49.728 --> 01:00:51.963
Oh, you're welcome.

01:00:51.996 --> 01:00:54.099
I'm gonna go finish my paper
so come find me

01:00:54.132 --> 01:00:56.401
when you're done talking.
Be in my room, okay?

01:00:56.434 --> 01:00:58.703
Okay.

01:00:58.737 --> 01:01:01.407
So Kadisha told me what
happened.

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:05.577
I just... want to know
what my options are.

01:01:05.610 --> 01:01:09.949
Kadisha said you were
considering suing your father.

01:01:09.981 --> 01:01:12.284
Yeah, for what he said.

01:01:12.318 --> 01:01:13.753
Did he say something publicly

01:01:13.786 --> 01:01:15.387
or was it just the
one Facebook post?

01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:17.456
Just the post.

01:01:17.489 --> 01:01:19.391
Okay.

01:01:19.425 --> 01:01:21.627
But he posted on the
event page for my fundraiser...

01:01:21.659 --> 01:01:23.929
I'm sure everybody's seen
it by now.

01:01:23.963 --> 01:01:27.967
Right. Well, I can...

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.469
try to, sort of, outline
things for you

01:01:29.501 --> 01:01:32.237
as best as I can, but before we
go any further,

01:01:32.271 --> 01:01:35.608
I need to make it clear, I
couldn't act as your lawyer.

01:01:35.641 --> 01:01:38.110
I'm not a litigator, so it
wouldn't make sense

01:01:38.143 --> 01:01:39.345
for me to take on your case,

01:01:39.378 --> 01:01:42.914
when, or if, it makes it
into the courts.

01:01:42.947 --> 01:01:47.118
But I can recommend somebody,
okay? If that happens.

01:01:47.152 --> 01:01:49.121
So you can't sue him?

01:01:49.153 --> 01:01:51.523
No, I'm in tax law, but I can
give you a name.

01:01:51.556 --> 01:01:54.359
I just... I want to know what
I can do,

01:01:54.393 --> 01:01:56.496
and I want the post deleted.

01:01:56.528 --> 01:02:00.298
Have you had any sort of contact
with your father recently?

01:02:00.331 --> 01:02:04.170
No...
I mean, he follows me on social media

01:02:04.202 --> 01:02:07.038
and he sees what I'm posting,
that I'm making a difference

01:02:07.072 --> 01:02:08.875
and I'm raising money...

01:02:09.974 --> 01:02:13.011
He's always been very jealous

01:02:13.045 --> 01:02:15.947
of any success I've had.

01:02:15.981 --> 01:02:19.151
All right, well, there are a few
different strategies.

01:02:19.184 --> 01:02:20.820
I mean, you could sue.

01:02:20.853 --> 01:02:22.954
But there are a few things you
need to determine first.

01:02:22.987 --> 01:02:25.790
One, I would make sure and take
a picture of that post

01:02:25.824 --> 01:02:27.293
in case it gets removed.

01:02:27.326 --> 01:02:28.793
You want to account for
its existence,

01:02:28.827 --> 01:02:30.663
prove that it was published.

01:02:30.695 --> 01:02:33.699
Uh, two, you're going to need
evidence that his statement

01:02:33.731 --> 01:02:37.202
was false, so possibly
contacting your doctor

01:02:37.235 --> 01:02:39.371
and having them provide records.

01:02:39.405 --> 01:02:43.109
Do you think it's a possibility
that you could call your father?

01:02:46.711 --> 01:02:49.148
I can't...

01:02:49.181 --> 01:02:50.816
Because another option

01:02:50.849 --> 01:02:53.152
is to speak with him, have him
retract the statement,

01:02:53.184 --> 01:02:55.353
and then make a public apology.

01:02:55.387 --> 01:02:57.123
No, I want to sue.

01:02:59.724 --> 01:03:01.594
Sorry, can I see the post again?

01:03:02.594 --> 01:03:04.062
Uh, yeah.

01:03:09.068 --> 01:03:10.703
Yeah, it's still up.

01:03:19.277 --> 01:03:21.846
Hm, it's good for you, though.

01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:23.583
"She is faking cancer.

01:03:23.615 --> 01:03:27.753
"The money she is raising is for
herself, not for charities."

01:03:29.755 --> 01:03:31.724
He's stating it as fact.

01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:39.599
Are you doing okay?

01:03:42.768 --> 01:03:44.737
Yeah, I'm just upset.

01:03:48.740 --> 01:03:51.043
Do you have any idea why he
would say

01:03:51.076 --> 01:03:52.579
you're faking your illness?

01:03:54.579 --> 01:03:56.248
To stop my fundraising campaign?

01:03:57.650 --> 01:04:00.586
Is there any truth
to what he said?

01:04:00.619 --> 01:04:01.954
No.

01:04:02.954 --> 01:04:04.623
Okay.

01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:16.469
After my mom killed herself, I
pretended to be sick for a while

01:04:16.501 --> 01:04:18.804
so that I wouldn't have to
go to school.

01:04:18.836 --> 01:04:21.474
That was in high school?

01:04:21.507 --> 01:04:22.775
Yeah.

01:04:24.309 --> 01:04:25.678
Okay.

01:04:25.710 --> 01:04:28.480
Could I have gotten in trouble
for that?

01:04:28.514 --> 01:04:30.416
No, no, I don't think so, I
mean...

01:04:30.449 --> 01:04:34.086
Not for that, not legally.

01:04:34.119 --> 01:04:36.622
So it's not a crime.

01:04:36.655 --> 01:04:38.457
You faked an illness to skip
some school

01:04:38.489 --> 01:04:41.760
during an incredibly traumatic
time in your life.

01:04:41.793 --> 01:04:45.830
I want to ask... what would
be the case

01:04:45.864 --> 01:04:47.367
if that would happen again?

01:04:48.666 --> 01:04:49.969
If you faked an illness?

01:04:50.001 --> 01:04:51.471
If...

01:04:52.871 --> 01:04:54.307
Yeah.

01:04:59.478 --> 01:05:04.383
Well, that would depend on a
number of factors, the...

01:05:04.416 --> 01:05:09.021
How much money have you raised?

01:05:09.054 --> 01:05:10.456
About $3,000.

01:05:10.489 --> 01:05:12.692
No, not just the campaign you're
doing now.

01:05:12.724 --> 01:05:15.994
In total, from earlier
fundraisers.

01:05:16.027 --> 01:05:18.797
How much, Katie?

01:05:18.831 --> 01:05:21.500
Well, does it really make a
difference how much?

01:05:21.532 --> 01:05:23.068
Did you raise over $5,000?

01:05:23.101 --> 01:05:24.335
Yes.

01:05:24.369 --> 01:05:28.173
How much? Give me a ballpark.

01:05:32.744 --> 01:05:36.848
About $24,000. About that.

01:05:38.851 --> 01:05:41.887
Defrauding the public or persons
exceeding $5,000

01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:43.755
is an indictable offense.

01:05:45.523 --> 01:05:47.592
What does that mean?

01:05:47.626 --> 01:05:49.762
It means the
possibility of jail time.

01:05:53.766 --> 01:05:57.836
So if you were faking an illness

01:05:57.869 --> 01:05:59.672
and taking money,

01:05:59.704 --> 01:06:02.373
or running those fundraising
campaigns for personal gain,

01:06:02.407 --> 01:06:05.044
then yes, it is a crime.

01:06:13.251 --> 01:06:15.788
Can you return the money, Katie?

01:06:17.789 --> 01:06:19.458
No...

01:06:19.490 --> 01:06:21.159
- Why not?
- It's gone.

01:06:29.168 --> 01:06:32.304
I'm going to give you the name
of a friend of mine.

01:06:32.336 --> 01:06:33.972
David Loman.

01:06:37.342 --> 01:06:40.311
You can call his office
in the morning

01:06:40.344 --> 01:06:42.180
and tell them I sent you.

01:06:52.023 --> 01:06:53.925
I'd like you to leave now,
please.

01:06:53.958 --> 01:06:56.161
I don't want you speaking to
Kadisha.

01:09:20.238 --> 01:09:24.143
(chattering indistinctly

01:09:31.149 --> 01:09:34.086
Hi, I was just wondering if
Julia is in?

01:09:34.118 --> 01:09:37.121
I was in yesterday and I dropped
off some documents with you.

01:09:37.154 --> 01:09:41.292
She is, um, she's in a meeting,
but, uh... hold tight,

01:09:41.326 --> 01:09:42.795
she'll want to see you,
so just take a seat.

01:09:42.828 --> 01:09:44.129
It will just be a moment.

01:09:44.162 --> 01:09:45.431
Okay.

01:10:21.966 --> 01:10:23.668
Do you recognize me?

01:10:23.702 --> 01:10:26.438
What? No, why would I?

01:10:50.194 --> 01:10:51.396
Katie.

01:10:51.430 --> 01:10:53.565
Hi.

01:10:53.597 --> 01:10:55.833
Uh, this is Professor Harney.

01:10:55.867 --> 01:10:57.469
Hi, Katie.

01:10:57.502 --> 01:11:00.172
Uh, yeah, I've met you once.

01:11:00.204 --> 01:11:01.873
Yes, I remember, you're
hard to forget.

01:11:01.907 --> 01:11:04.743
It's good that you came, we
wanted to talk to you.

01:11:04.775 --> 01:11:06.478
Can we go into the board room?

01:11:06.511 --> 01:11:08.647
Uh, the lady was just grabbing
me a glass of water,

01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:09.882
I was gonna grab...

01:11:09.914 --> 01:11:11.250
Oh, Rose can bring it in.

01:11:11.283 --> 01:11:12.518
Oh, I just need to take my
medication.

01:11:12.551 --> 01:11:14.186
- Okay.
- She was gonna, um...

01:11:14.219 --> 01:11:16.087
She was gonna ask you about
those copies

01:11:16.121 --> 01:11:18.590
of my medical records.

01:11:18.622 --> 01:11:21.893
Um, we're actually going to have
to press pause on that

01:11:21.926 --> 01:11:23.594
for the time being.

01:11:23.627 --> 01:11:25.363
I've already spoken with them
and they understand

01:11:25.396 --> 01:11:27.265
that there are a few things

01:11:27.298 --> 01:11:29.600
that we need to sort out
on our end.

01:11:29.634 --> 01:11:31.703
We've pulled your application.

01:11:34.105 --> 01:11:36.274
No, that's a mistake.

01:11:36.307 --> 01:11:38.377
You could possibly reapply
next year,

01:11:38.409 --> 01:11:41.579
but it would be good for us to
go over some things now.

01:11:41.613 --> 01:11:45.050
Yeah. Guys, why don't we take it
into the boardroom.

01:11:45.082 --> 01:11:46.985
Yeah. Come on.

01:11:48.953 --> 01:11:50.188
- That way.
- Okay.

01:11:54.893 --> 01:11:56.462
So come on in.

01:12:02.466 --> 01:12:05.237
I don't have to be here...

01:12:05.270 --> 01:12:07.272
What?

01:12:07.305 --> 01:12:10.409
You're gonna do what you
have to do,

01:12:10.442 --> 01:12:13.712
and I'm gonna do what
I have to do.

01:12:13.744 --> 01:12:15.447
Come on, guys. This...

01:12:15.479 --> 01:12:17.548
Yeah, Katie,
can you just come in and sit down

01:12:17.582 --> 01:12:18.918
and we can talk?

01:12:19.917 --> 01:12:21.519
You okay?

01:12:25.524 --> 01:12:28.360
Wait, what are you doing?
Katie? Katie?

01:12:30.962 --> 01:12:32.198
Katie!

01:12:36.501 --> 01:12:37.770
Give it to me!

01:13:08.399 --> 01:13:10.601
What'd he say?

01:13:10.635 --> 01:13:13.605
You can... you can go in.

01:13:13.637 --> 01:13:15.006
How much will it cost?

01:13:15.039 --> 01:13:16.841
I don't know, he didn't say.

01:13:16.875 --> 01:13:18.277
How much for you?

01:13:18.310 --> 01:13:20.312
I don't worry about that.

01:13:22.046 --> 01:13:25.516
You know, just, um, don't
bug this guy

01:13:25.550 --> 01:13:26.885
with all your questions.

01:13:26.917 --> 01:13:30.655
He's a... just be careful
with him, okay?

01:13:31.655 --> 01:13:33.958
Okay.

01:13:33.992 --> 01:13:37.029
Oh, what, um, what did you tell
your girlfriend?

01:13:38.029 --> 01:13:39.431
Nothing yet.

01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:44.269
Will you wait for me?

01:13:46.704 --> 01:13:47.939
Yeah.

01:14:47.931 --> 01:14:51.769
Aside from the baldness,
you don't look that sick.

01:14:51.802 --> 01:14:55.306
I don't eat a lot... and
I buy pills.

01:14:55.340 --> 01:14:58.110
I act like I'm tired all
the time.

01:14:58.143 --> 01:15:01.913
Do you have any actual medical
proof of your illness?

01:15:01.945 --> 01:15:04.315
I have a scar on
my arm that I tell people

01:15:04.349 --> 01:15:06.318
is from when they took the
tumour out,

01:15:06.350 --> 01:15:08.920
and I've had some records made
for a school bursary.

01:15:08.953 --> 01:15:10.656
What are you looking for?

01:15:10.689 --> 01:15:13.125
I'm looking for something I can
use. Take your jacket off.

01:15:13.158 --> 01:15:15.427
You make 'em yourself?

01:15:15.460 --> 01:15:18.631
No a medical resident I met
through Owen helped me.

01:15:20.631 --> 01:15:22.900
Do you have a physician?

01:15:22.934 --> 01:15:25.070
Not really.
My old family doctor,

01:15:25.103 --> 01:15:26.938
but I haven't seen him in years.

01:15:31.842 --> 01:15:34.078
I'm going to act as your doctor
going forward.

01:15:34.112 --> 01:15:36.948
I'll write you a doctor's note
you can show people,

01:15:36.980 --> 01:15:39.417
post online, whatever you want.

01:15:39.451 --> 01:15:40.918
can I get that today?

01:15:40.952 --> 01:15:44.690
We'll discuss that. Take your
sweater off too.

01:15:44.722 --> 01:15:47.158
I can also build you a patient
history.

01:15:47.192 --> 01:15:49.761
This will support your cancer
diagnosis

01:15:49.793 --> 01:15:52.331
and your treatment timeline.

01:15:52.363 --> 01:15:53.764
Is this the scar?

01:15:53.797 --> 01:15:55.033
Yeah.

01:15:56.234 --> 01:15:58.136
Stand on the scale over here.

01:15:58.168 --> 01:16:00.037
Ideally that will cover
everything up to now

01:16:00.070 --> 01:16:02.073
and whatever you want going
forward.

01:16:03.841 --> 01:16:05.309
How long will it take?

01:16:05.342 --> 01:16:08.145
Awhile, but we can start with
the note,

01:16:08.179 --> 01:16:10.215
and any other immediate needs.
Have a seat.

01:16:15.220 --> 01:16:17.789
I'm gonna give you an injection
of Saxenda.

01:16:17.822 --> 01:16:22.159
It's a weight loss drug, usually
used for diabetes.

01:16:22.193 --> 01:16:23.994
It will change your mood
a little.

01:16:24.028 --> 01:16:25.797
You'll feel a little more
tender.

01:16:25.829 --> 01:16:27.466
You'll look more sickly
and weak.

01:16:27.498 --> 01:16:30.301
You can tell people that
your doctor

01:16:30.335 --> 01:16:31.904
upped your steroid dosage.

01:16:40.912 --> 01:16:42.247
It's gonna feel like somebody
punched you hard,

01:16:42.279 --> 01:16:43.748
but that will pass.

01:16:43.782 --> 01:16:46.818
I'll need to see your insurance
information.

01:16:46.850 --> 01:16:49.420
Okay.

01:16:49.453 --> 01:16:51.722
I'm gonna start by having you
filing claims

01:16:51.756 --> 01:16:54.025
for Dexamethasone and
Hydromorphone.

01:16:54.057 --> 01:16:56.595
My rate starts at $8,000.

01:16:56.627 --> 01:16:58.729
That covers establishing your
history,

01:16:58.762 --> 01:17:02.768
prescriptions, any statements I
have to make on your behalf.

01:17:02.801 --> 01:17:05.504
After that, it's $750 for
every meeting.

01:17:05.537 --> 01:17:07.672
Insurance will help cover
some of that.

01:17:07.704 --> 01:17:09.940
We should meet as regularly
as possible,

01:17:09.974 --> 01:17:12.444
but it will depend on how much
you can afford.

01:17:12.476 --> 01:17:15.380
Today is gonna cost you $5,000
no matter what we do

01:17:15.412 --> 01:17:17.581
because you're buying my
silence.

01:17:17.614 --> 01:17:21.019
I'll wait to receive that, and
then I'll get started.

01:17:28.059 --> 01:17:30.128
Can we work towards getting
me better?

01:17:32.130 --> 01:17:34.231
You want to go into remission?

01:17:34.265 --> 01:17:37.136
- Yes.
- How soon?

01:17:39.304 --> 01:17:42.306
I don't know, um...

01:17:42.340 --> 01:17:44.176
I have to figure that out.

01:18:28.453 --> 01:18:29.688
Hey, babe.

01:18:36.661 --> 01:18:37.895
Hey.

01:18:44.702 --> 01:18:46.672
How long have you been here?

01:18:48.672 --> 01:18:50.341
Just now.

01:18:52.911 --> 01:18:54.279
I'm sorry. I should have
called you.

01:18:54.311 --> 01:18:55.980
Where have you been?

01:18:59.551 --> 01:19:02.588
I've been trying to figure
everything out.

01:19:04.588 --> 01:19:07.024
I talked to a lawyer and I'm
going to sue my dad.

01:19:07.057 --> 01:19:09.961
I tried to call you
a million times.

01:19:09.993 --> 01:19:12.864
Why the hell didn't you
call me back?

01:19:26.043 --> 01:19:27.912
I've been freaking out.

01:19:29.913 --> 01:19:31.750
Everyone's just been.

01:19:33.618 --> 01:19:37.456
And... and you just disappeared.

01:19:43.060 --> 01:19:44.762
Is it true?

01:19:49.766 --> 01:19:51.903
Do I need to show you proof
now too?

01:19:51.935 --> 01:19:53.203
Why would your
dad say something like that?

01:19:53.237 --> 01:19:54.439
He's a liar!

01:19:54.471 --> 01:19:56.907
- What does he want?!
- I don't know.

01:19:56.940 --> 01:19:59.443
Money!

01:19:59.476 --> 01:20:04.114
So he's... he's... he's
blackmailing you?

01:20:04.148 --> 01:20:05.850
That's why you needed my money.

01:20:05.882 --> 01:20:08.586
No, no, that was for the flight.
Like I said.

01:20:08.619 --> 01:20:09.887
Don't touch me.

01:20:12.756 --> 01:20:14.492
I don't understand.

01:20:17.494 --> 01:20:19.931
Why didn't you call me back?

01:20:27.238 --> 01:20:28.840
I'm sorry, but...

01:20:30.341 --> 01:20:31.610
you've been afraid of my
sickness

01:20:31.643 --> 01:20:33.278
ever since we started dating.

01:20:33.310 --> 01:20:34.578
What are you talking about?

01:20:34.612 --> 01:20:36.748
You were sick when we
started dating.

01:20:36.780 --> 01:20:39.951
And I've been scared every day
that you're gonna leave me.

01:20:39.984 --> 01:20:41.386
Oh, that's just...

01:20:41.418 --> 01:20:44.590
That's just your own
psychological bullshit.

01:20:48.592 --> 01:20:50.295
Have you been lying to me
the whole time?

01:20:50.328 --> 01:20:51.863
No, of course not.

01:20:53.698 --> 01:20:55.100
I need you to believe me.

01:20:55.132 --> 01:20:56.501
I do, if you tell me he's lying.

01:20:56.533 --> 01:20:57.802
He's lying.

01:21:00.671 --> 01:21:02.807
I really want to believe you.

01:21:13.650 --> 01:21:15.153
Here, look.

01:21:15.185 --> 01:21:17.355
My dad sent me that this
morning.

01:21:19.356 --> 01:21:21.460
I told you what
he's really like.

01:21:53.490 --> 01:21:55.761
They suspended your campaign.

01:21:58.195 --> 01:21:59.898
What?

01:22:01.164 --> 01:22:02.868
The page is down.

01:22:11.876 --> 01:22:15.579
I reported his...
his post on Facebook.

01:22:17.582 --> 01:22:19.384
It's still there.

01:22:22.386 --> 01:22:25.223
They'll take it down. Just not
sure how quickly.

01:22:29.393 --> 01:22:32.197
I know you're not telling me
everything.

01:22:38.202 --> 01:22:41.271
Did you lie about it spreading?

01:22:41.305 --> 01:22:42.707
No.

01:22:42.739 --> 01:22:45.443
- Did you even have the MRI?
- Yes. Of course.

01:22:45.475 --> 01:22:46.710
Do you want to see those
scans, too?

01:22:46.743 --> 01:22:49.380
- I think so.
- Okay.

01:22:49.412 --> 01:22:51.248
I'll get them for you.

01:23:04.427 --> 01:23:06.564
Jenn, everything is going
to be okay.

01:23:09.567 --> 01:23:11.903
I just don't understand why he
would say this?

01:23:11.935 --> 01:23:14.706
- How is this possible?
- You're not listening to me.

01:23:22.279 --> 01:23:23.814
Answer it.

01:23:25.416 --> 01:23:26.951
I don't even know who it is.

01:23:26.984 --> 01:23:28.453
Just fucking answer it!

01:23:36.027 --> 01:23:37.962
Hello?

01:23:37.994 --> 01:23:39.296
<i>Hi,
this is Heather Shearer from CHPR.</i>

01:23:39.329 --> 01:23:42.332
<i>Is this Katherine Arneson?</i>

01:23:42.365 --> 01:23:43.967
Uh, uh, yeah.

01:23:44.001 --> 01:23:45.936
<i>Hi, I'm calling to see if
you're available</i>

01:23:45.970 --> 01:23:48.006
<i>to speak with Matt Nichols on
the morning show tomorrow</i>

01:23:48.038 --> 01:23:51.643
<i>around 8:15am.</i>

01:23:51.676 --> 01:23:53.478
- On the radio?
- <i>Yes.</i>

01:23:53.511 --> 01:23:55.480
<i>We understand that you're a
student at McMaster</i>

01:23:55.512 --> 01:23:57.681
<i>and yesterday some allegations
surfaced</i>

01:23:57.715 --> 01:23:59.650
<i>about your cancer diagnosis.</i>

01:23:59.684 --> 01:24:02.119
<i>Was it your father who did
the post?</i>

01:24:02.153 --> 01:24:03.755
- Yeah, he's lying.
- <i>Right.</i>

01:24:03.787 --> 01:24:05.923
He's trying to hurt me.

01:24:05.957 --> 01:24:08.159
<i>I'm sorry to hear that.
We've been doing a few pieces</i>

01:24:08.192 --> 01:24:11.596
<i>about social media shaming, and
Facebook, Twitter backlash,</i>

01:24:11.628 --> 01:24:14.666
<i>and that sort of thing, and we
feel like your story</i>

01:24:14.698 --> 01:24:16.800
<i>would fit right in to what
we've been doing.</i>

01:24:16.833 --> 01:24:18.836
<i>Would you be interested in
coming on for a bit</i>

01:24:18.869 --> 01:24:20.805
<i>and telling us your story?</i>

01:24:20.837 --> 01:24:24.108
Uh, yeah. Yeah, okay.

01:24:24.140 --> 01:24:27.311
<i>Great. Look, I'll have one of
my producers call you back</i>

01:24:27.345 --> 01:24:29.480
<i>in about an hour or so and go
over the details,</i>

01:24:29.512 --> 01:24:32.182
<i>timing, et cetera. Will you
still be up?</i>

01:24:32.216 --> 01:24:34.485
- Yeah, yeah, I'll be up.
- <i>Okay, that's perfect.</i>

01:24:34.518 --> 01:24:35.886
<i>It was great speaking with you,
Katherine.</i>

01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:37.154
Yeah, thank you so much.

01:24:37.188 --> 01:24:39.423
- <i>Okay, bye.</i>
- Okay, bye.

01:24:42.993 --> 01:24:46.163
Jenn, that's crazy, this...

01:24:46.197 --> 01:24:47.998
this woman, this producer,

01:24:48.032 --> 01:24:51.502
from the Morning Show from CHPR,

01:24:51.534 --> 01:24:53.805
they want me to be on their
show tomorrow.

01:24:53.837 --> 01:24:57.942
They want me to tell my story
about my dad and everything.

01:25:02.947 --> 01:25:04.349
Jenn?

01:25:06.182 --> 01:25:09.020
This could be what we need to
prove that he's lying.

01:25:11.588 --> 01:25:15.527
I need your help with what to
say and everything.

01:25:18.529 --> 01:25:21.099
I'm not sure I can help you.

01:25:24.702 --> 01:25:26.538
Are you going to leave me?

01:25:27.904 --> 01:25:29.740
I don't want to...

01:25:31.542 --> 01:25:35.113
I'll... I'll lie to you
right now!

01:25:35.145 --> 01:25:37.849
I'll say that I'm not sick, if
that makes it easier.

01:25:37.881 --> 01:25:41.752
I don't care, I will do anything
I can to keep you!

01:25:41.786 --> 01:25:45.556
My dad has lied his whole life.

01:25:45.588 --> 01:25:47.125
You know that.

01:25:48.725 --> 01:25:50.795
I have never had a good thing

01:25:50.828 --> 01:25:52.430
that he hasn't tried to take
from me.

01:25:52.462 --> 01:25:54.398
Parents don't just do that to
their kids, I mean...

01:25:54.431 --> 01:25:55.966
Your parents don't.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.168
No, shit.... that... that's not
what I meant.

01:26:01.771 --> 01:26:03.608
Do you think I chose this?

01:26:07.078 --> 01:26:11.115
People look at me and stare,
and avoid me.

01:26:12.115 --> 01:26:13.818
Nobody would choose this.

01:26:16.820 --> 01:26:18.655
We spent so much time together.

01:26:18.689 --> 01:26:22.226
How could I fake the tests and
the chemo and everything?

01:26:22.259 --> 01:26:24.127
You were just so private.

01:26:24.161 --> 01:26:26.596
It's not about that.

01:26:26.630 --> 01:26:29.100
You are the first good thing to
come into my life

01:26:29.132 --> 01:26:31.435
ever since my mom...

01:26:44.148 --> 01:26:47.385
I have never been in a real
relationship before.

01:26:49.386 --> 01:26:52.689
And I got scared that if you saw
what cancer was really like,

01:26:52.722 --> 01:26:54.492
that you would leave me.

01:26:58.496 --> 01:27:02.333
Maybe that was a mistake, I
don't know.

01:27:04.234 --> 01:27:06.804
I don't want to be alone again.

01:27:06.837 --> 01:27:09.507
I don't want to hurt you.

01:27:14.511 --> 01:27:16.179
I'm so sorry.

01:27:16.212 --> 01:27:18.750
No, it's not your fault.

01:27:22.353 --> 01:27:23.721
Can I kiss you?

01:27:32.729 --> 01:27:34.664
You believe me?

01:27:34.698 --> 01:27:36.267
I wanted to all day.

01:27:39.270 --> 01:27:41.106
How do we fix this?

01:27:44.108 --> 01:27:46.043
We have to tell the truth.

01:28:00.224 --> 01:28:03.528
They took it down.

01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:04.862
Hm, what?

01:28:04.895 --> 01:28:07.865
The Facebook
post is down.

01:28:07.898 --> 01:28:09.833
- When?
- I don't know.

01:28:09.867 --> 01:28:12.302
It was down when I got up, I
just saw it.

01:28:20.743 --> 01:28:22.146
Told you.

01:28:23.646 --> 01:28:25.050
I know.

01:28:29.453 --> 01:28:30.721
Are you going to have a shower?

01:28:30.753 --> 01:28:32.556
Uh-huh.

01:28:32.590 --> 01:28:34.125
We don't have much time.

01:29:08.158 --> 01:29:09.793
We're a little delayed, but
we're going to bring you in

01:29:09.827 --> 01:29:12.630
- in probably five.
- Sounds great.

01:29:12.662 --> 01:29:15.465
Do you need anything?
There's water, juice...

01:29:15.498 --> 01:29:17.434
Oh no,
I think we're fine, thanks.

01:29:17.467 --> 01:29:18.935
The bathroom is just down there,

01:29:18.969 --> 01:29:20.505
and I'll come get you when
we're ready.

01:29:20.537 --> 01:29:22.139
- Okay, thank you.
- Thank you.

01:29:28.845 --> 01:29:30.881
This place is smaller than
I expected.

01:29:56.907 --> 01:29:59.911
I want to be a part of
everything from now on, okay?

01:30:06.317 --> 01:30:10.154
I want to be at your
appointments,

01:30:10.186 --> 01:30:13.056
and just... be there to hold
your hand.

01:30:15.225 --> 01:30:19.863
And just be there with you,
because I'm not afraid.

01:30:26.436 --> 01:30:28.305
I might have been before, but
there's no point

01:30:28.338 --> 01:30:30.742
unless we're together in
all of this.

01:30:39.750 --> 01:30:41.118
Okay.

01:30:49.126 --> 01:30:50.762
Will you marry me?

01:30:52.762 --> 01:30:54.032
What?

01:30:57.033 --> 01:30:58.936
I don't ever want to be
without you.

01:31:03.539 --> 01:31:07.244
I'll tell you everything if
you say yes.

01:31:07.278 --> 01:31:10.782
I won't lie, I promise.
I won't be sick anymore.

01:31:13.783 --> 01:31:17.554
There's no point unless we're in
everything together, right?

01:31:19.555 --> 01:31:21.591
Katie, we're ready for you.

01:31:21.625 --> 01:31:23.060
Katie?

01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:25.762
Mm-hm.
