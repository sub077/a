00:02:45.188 --> 00:02:46.228
<b>Seriously?</b>

00:02:48.188 --> 00:02:50.348
<b>Isn't it common sense
to drive slowly at night?</b>

00:02:50.521 --> 00:02:51.651
<b>That's quite a dent.</b>

00:02:53.938 --> 00:02:55.018
<b>Are you okay?</b>

00:02:55.104 --> 00:02:56.734
<b>- Yes, and you?
- I'm fine.</b>

00:02:57.354 --> 00:02:59.104
<b>Why did you drive so fast
at night?</b>

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:02.439
<b>- How are the photos?
- Sorry?</b>

00:03:03.938 --> 00:03:05.558
<b>There's really no need for that.</b>

00:03:06.854 --> 00:03:08.104
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

00:03:08.813 --> 00:03:10.773
<b>Photos are crucial
when claiming insurance.</b>

00:03:11.188 --> 00:03:12.728
<b>You had better not
change your story.</b>

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:14.149
<b>It's scratched...</b>

00:04:10.104 --> 00:04:13.444
<b>Another murder took place
in a land development site</b>

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:15.689
<b>near Cheonan early this morning.</b>

<b>Since last year, many murders

00:04:22.604 --> 00:04:25.604
<b>but the police

00:04:25.688 --> 00:04:28.438
<b>We want to close them too,
you know.</b>

00:04:28.896 --> 00:04:30.306
<b>We want to close cases,</b>

00:04:38.604 --> 00:04:39.904
<b>Turn off the siren!</b>

00:04:40.563 --> 00:04:43.693
<b>No one in this town

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:47.439
<b>They just couldn't care less.</b>

00:04:48.021 --> 00:04:50.941
<b>- What a filthy world...
- Tell me about it.</b>

00:04:53.521 --> 00:04:55.851
<b>Gosh, look at those thugs.</b>

00:04:55.938 --> 00:04:58.308
<b>Trash like them

00:05:00.146 --> 00:05:02.766
<b>Where are you going?
We're on a case!</b>

00:05:02.854 --> 00:05:04.604
<b>Whatever. Does it look like
we're on a case?</b>

00:05:04.771 --> 00:05:06.351
<b>- Tae-seok!
- See you at the scene!</b>

00:05:07.313 --> 00:05:09.563
<b>- Can't you even do that?
- I'm sorry.</b>

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:10.769

Please go.</b>

00:05:12.854 --> 00:05:14.904
<b>- Be on your way. I'm a cop.
- Sir.</b>

00:05:15.063 --> 00:05:16.733
<b>I told you
to stay out of my sight.</b>

00:05:19.146 --> 00:05:20.266
<b>Block the entrance.</b>

00:05:20.688 --> 00:05:21.898
<b>Step aside.</b>

00:05:22.396 --> 00:05:25.146
<b>To what do we owe the pleasure

00:05:26.063 --> 00:05:29.273
<b>Does a cop need permission

00:05:30.021 --> 00:05:31.021
<b>Sir.</b>

00:05:31.104 --> 00:05:32.104
<b>Come on, sir!</b>

00:05:32.604 --> 00:05:35.734
<b>Come back another time.
Today's a bad day.</b>

00:05:36.854 --> 00:05:38.814
<b>It must be one of those days.</b>

00:05:39.854 --> 00:05:42.564
<b>The roads were jammed

00:05:43.354 --> 00:05:44.854
<b>All right, fine.</b>

00:05:48.354 --> 00:05:50.904
<b>Here. Now please go away.</b>

00:05:54.896 --> 00:05:58.646
<b>You bastard. What do you take
Korean cops for?</b>

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:01.349
<b>How dare you try to bribe me?</b>

00:06:02.188 --> 00:06:04.188
<b>GAMELAND</b>

<b>Here you go, fucking jerks.</b>

00:06:07.438 --> 00:06:10.938
<b>You guys should've
been more careful.</b>

00:06:12.146 --> 00:06:16.556
<b>How dare gangsters

00:06:21.813 --> 00:06:23.193
<b>Please continue.</b>

00:06:23.938 --> 00:06:25.228
<b>I hope you win!</b>

00:06:50.271 --> 00:06:51.271
<b>Boss.</b>

00:06:56.104 --> 00:06:57.904
<b>That fucking cop's here.</b>

00:07:00.771 --> 00:07:01.771
<b>Put it down.</b>

00:07:10.521 --> 00:07:12.731
<b>- Wrap him up and send him back.
- Yes, Boss.</b>

00:07:18.146 --> 00:07:20.516
<b>I received 200,000 won

<b>Our share is ten percent,</b>

<b>Who the fuck...</b>

00:07:29.854 --> 00:07:30.904
<b>Open it.</b>

00:07:34.646 --> 00:07:35.646
<b>Salute.</b>

00:07:35.729 --> 00:07:36.769
<b>Whatever.</b>

00:07:40.271 --> 00:07:43.101
<b>You're charged with illegal

00:07:43.354 --> 00:07:44.984
<b>Remain silent</b>

00:07:45.063 --> 00:07:47.523
<b>or retain a lawyer if you want.</b>

<b>You're coming with me.</b>

00:07:49.229 --> 00:07:52.599
<b>Detective, why don't

00:07:52.688 --> 00:07:54.898
<b>Buddy, come out here.</b>

00:07:57.979 --> 00:07:59.349
<b>Don't forget to put those on.</b>

00:08:03.771 --> 00:08:05.021
<b>- Good morning, Boss!
- Good morning, Boss!</b>

00:08:16.854 --> 00:08:17.904
<b>Yes, it's me.</b>

00:08:18.646 --> 00:08:20.306
<b>That bastard's back again.</b>

00:08:20.479 --> 00:08:21.519
<b>What?</b>

00:08:22.188 --> 00:08:25.478
<b>I sent him to a crime scene.
What's he doing there?</b>

00:08:27.563 --> 00:08:29.853
<b>Ask the fucker yourself.</b>

00:08:30.979 --> 00:08:32.689
<b>Tell Sang-do I'm heading there.</b>

<b>You can't do this, not when you

<b>Taking all the money

<b>has caused your boys

00:08:43.354 --> 00:08:46.734
<b>I already advised you against

00:08:46.938 --> 00:08:49.348
<b>Start a currency exchange shop

00:08:49.563 --> 00:08:52.603

00:08:52.771 --> 00:08:54.731
<b>All that for some chump change?</b>

00:08:54.813 --> 00:08:57.483
<b>I'm busy as it is

00:08:57.896 --> 00:09:00.596
<b>Can't you cut him off

00:09:00.813 --> 00:09:02.353
<b>My boys need the money.</b>

00:09:02.438 --> 00:09:04.648
<b>All right, fine.
I'll take care of the bastard.</b>

00:09:16.938 --> 00:09:17.938
<b>What?</b>

00:09:18.021 --> 00:09:19.021
<b>Are you kidding me?</b>

00:09:19.229 --> 00:09:21.309

00:09:24.646 --> 00:09:26.476
<b>I really don't like this guy.</b>

00:09:26.563 --> 00:09:27.733
<b>Let me just turn off...</b>

00:09:27.813 --> 00:09:29.603
<b>- the electric fan.
- Keep walking.</b>

00:09:34.938 --> 00:09:36.188
<b>Stop right there.</b>

00:09:36.563 --> 00:09:37.733
<b>As you wish.</b>

00:09:44.563 --> 00:09:46.353
<b>- Thanks for the ride.
- Thank you.</b>

00:09:50.104 --> 00:09:52.314
<b>Seriously? Is this necessary?</b>

00:09:52.438 --> 00:09:55.688
<b>I gave you a ride!</b>

00:09:58.646 --> 00:09:59.846
<b>Here's my payment.</b>

00:10:00.729 --> 00:10:02.019
<b>Now, kneel on the ground!</b>

00:10:02.354 --> 00:10:05.274
<b>I'm going to report you.</b>

00:10:05.479 --> 00:10:07.099
<b>Bloody traffic jam.</b>

00:10:07.188 --> 00:10:09.598
<b>Where the heck have you been?</b>

00:10:10.396 --> 00:10:12.226
<b>Gosh, there's a crowd already.</b>

00:10:12.979 --> 00:10:14.019
<b>Get rid of them.</b>

00:10:14.771 --> 00:10:17.231
<b>Hello, reporters.
One moment, please!</b>

00:10:17.313 --> 00:10:20.733
<b>You can take photos later.
Can you all move back for now?</b>

00:10:22.479 --> 00:10:25.309
<b>Secure the scene properly!
What have you been doing?</b>

00:10:25.563 --> 00:10:27.943
<b>Hey, move aside!</b>

00:10:28.771 --> 00:10:30.231
<b>Stay back if you were late.</b>

00:10:31.229 --> 00:10:34.479
<b>Don't head toward the bridge

00:10:35.854 --> 00:10:39.194
<b>I just received a call

00:10:53.104 --> 00:10:54.154
<b>Move back, please.</b>

00:10:56.063 --> 00:10:58.733
<b>People are gathering over there!</b>

00:10:58.813 --> 00:11:00.063
<b>We're gaining an audience!</b>

00:11:00.146 --> 00:11:01.346
<b>Good day, officer.</b>

00:11:01.896 --> 00:11:03.146
<b>Did you identify the victim?</b>

00:11:03.229 --> 00:11:05.729
<b>We're checking his vehicle
number, so we'll find out soon.</b>

00:11:13.354 --> 00:11:14.984
<b>He died only a few hours ago</b>

00:11:16.604 --> 00:11:18.774
<b>between three and five
this morning.</b>

00:11:19.229 --> 00:11:21.649
<b>Cause of death is blood loss
due to stabbing</b>

00:11:21.729 --> 00:11:24.229
<b>or a heart attack.</b>

00:11:24.563 --> 00:11:25.773
<b>That's my initial impression.</b>

00:11:26.354 --> 00:11:28.234
<b>Hey, come and take some photos.</b>

00:11:29.688 --> 00:11:30.768
<b>Did you get it?</b>

00:11:40.896 --> 00:11:43.516
<b>Make sure
you don't miss anything.</b>

00:11:44.729 --> 00:11:46.769
<b>Hey, Seo-jin. Over here!</b>

00:11:47.104 --> 00:11:48.154
<b>Can you take a look at this?</b>

00:11:48.854 --> 00:11:51.904
<b>I told you not to call me
by name at crime scenes.</b>

00:11:52.438 --> 00:11:55.018
<b>My apologies, Chief Cha.
Anyway, please take a look.</b>

00:11:55.354 --> 00:11:56.404
<b>What is it?</b>

00:11:58.354 --> 00:11:59.484
<b>Looks like rear-end collision, right?</b>

00:12:02.063 --> 00:12:04.903
<b>It does seem that way,
but then again, it doesn't.</b>

00:12:06.479 --> 00:12:08.189
<b>Could this be the motive?</b>

00:12:08.938 --> 00:12:11.268
<b>I wish it was. It's better
than premeditated murder.</b>

00:12:30.354 --> 00:12:32.524
<b>By the way, I should thank you</b>

00:12:32.729 --> 00:12:35.649
<b>for turning one of my boys
into a cripple.</b>

00:12:35.854 --> 00:12:38.194
<b>There are rules for a reason,
you know.</b>

00:12:41.188 --> 00:12:42.228
<b>Whatever.</b>

00:12:43.104 --> 00:12:45.904
<b>So businesses will be separate
but we'll share engineers.</b>

00:12:46.313 --> 00:12:47.313
<b>Got it.</b>

00:12:48.021 --> 00:12:51.351
<b>Shouldn't we resolve
the turf issue though?</b>

00:12:51.896 --> 00:12:52.936
<b>Let's be flexible about this.</b>

00:12:58.938 --> 00:13:01.058
<b>- Sang-do.
- Yes?</b>

00:13:03.354 --> 00:13:06.234
<b>If you keep getting favors,
you'll end up getting spoiled.</b>

00:13:07.146 --> 00:13:11.846
<b>Don't make trouble, and manage
the shop I assigned you.</b>

00:13:12.146 --> 00:13:14.846
<b>Everyone has his limit.</b>

00:13:15.729 --> 00:13:17.269
<b>If you cross the line,
you'll die.</b>

00:13:20.146 --> 00:13:23.186
<b>Come on, do you really think so?</b>

00:13:24.479 --> 00:13:25.809
<b>Guus Hiddink once said this.</b>

00:13:26.729 --> 00:13:28.979
<b>"I'm still fucking hungry."</b>

00:13:30.813 --> 00:13:32.443
<b>I have no capital,
no connections,</b>

00:13:33.354 --> 00:13:35.774
<b>so I'm still hungry.</b>

00:13:39.229 --> 00:13:40.229
<b>Sir.</b>

00:13:40.771 --> 00:13:44.351
<b>My boss is being lenient
because you two are friends.</b>

00:13:45.479 --> 00:13:48.649
<b>That's why he's giving you
the technology and engineers.</b>

<b>The slot arcade business</b>

<b>Are you raising your voice
in front of our bosses?</b>

00:13:58.604 --> 00:14:01.194
<b>Give us what?
Just shut up, asshole!</b>

00:14:01.271 --> 00:14:02.901
<b>Do you have a death wish?</b>

00:14:03.271 --> 00:14:04.351
<b>Shut the fuck up!</b>

<b>Look at him glaring at me.</b>

00:14:11.521 --> 00:14:12.561
<b>Hey, Dong-su.</b>

00:14:14.104 --> 00:14:16.404

<b>Yes, Boss.</b>

00:14:40.521 --> 00:14:43.481
<b>You shouldn't

<b>Come here.</b>

00:15:12.188 --> 00:15:13.228

<b>He has over

<b>The murderer is obviously

00:16:02.854 --> 00:16:03.854
<b>I'm here, sir.</b>

00:16:06.063 --> 00:16:08.983
<b>This case is likely
a robbery-homicide,</b>

00:16:09.146 --> 00:16:12.306
<b>so look for anyone
with similar criminal records.</b>

00:16:12.396 --> 00:16:13.436
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

00:16:13.729 --> 00:16:15.899
<b>You guys, back up Unit One.</b>

00:16:17.479 --> 00:16:18.769
<b>Three separate cases,
but one killer.</b>

00:16:19.813 --> 00:16:20.853
<b>What cases?</b>

00:16:21.188 --> 00:16:22.188
<b>Listen.</b>

00:16:22.896 --> 00:16:25.976
<b>A reservoir in Seosan
on July 15,</b>

00:16:26.688 --> 00:16:29.688
<b>Boryeong Sunbeach Motel
on July 23,</b>

00:16:29.771 --> 00:16:31.901
<b>and then last night's case.</b>

00:16:33.354 --> 00:16:35.604
<b>A knife was the murder weapon
in all three cases.</b>

00:16:35.813 --> 00:16:38.103
<b>Considering the length
and width of the knife,</b>

00:16:39.521 --> 00:16:41.061
<b>it could be the same.</b>

00:16:41.146 --> 00:16:42.556
<b>No, I'm certain it is.</b>

00:16:44.271 --> 00:16:45.441
<b>The suspect is a serial killer.</b>

00:16:46.313 --> 00:16:48.103
<b>This isn't the USA, you know.</b>

00:16:48.313 --> 00:16:50.523
<b>Gun possession is illegal,
so knives are the most common.</b>

00:16:51.354 --> 00:16:52.484
<b>That's nonsense.</b>

00:16:53.063 --> 00:16:55.853
<b>There are over
1,000 murders a year.</b>

00:16:56.063 --> 00:16:58.693
<b>Going by your logic, half
of them is done by one guy.</b>

00:16:58.771 --> 00:16:59.811
<b>Are you nuts?</b>

00:17:00.729 --> 00:17:03.849
<b>Who are you to mess with
another jurisdiction's cases?</b>

00:17:03.938 --> 00:17:06.938
<b>Does the killer care
about jurisdiction?</b>

00:17:07.854 --> 00:17:10.604
<b>If we don't catch him soon,
we'll be in big trouble.</b>

00:17:11.021 --> 00:17:13.191
<b>He's too meticulous
for this to be a random killing.</b>

00:17:13.646 --> 00:17:15.556
<b>He could strike again
at any time--</b>

00:17:15.646 --> 00:17:16.976
<b>This job is too easy for you,
isn't it?</b>

00:17:17.229 --> 00:17:18.809
<b>Murder cases aren't a joke.</b>

00:17:19.229 --> 00:17:20.519
<b>You can't just
jump to conclusions like that!</b>

00:17:20.604 --> 00:17:21.604
<b>That's not...</b>

00:17:22.938 --> 00:17:25.308
<b>These aren't random cases
I'm tying together.</b>

00:17:25.854 --> 00:17:27.854
<b>They each happened
about a week apart</b>

00:17:27.938 --> 00:17:30.348
<b>all around
South Chungcheong Province.</b>

00:17:31.021 --> 00:17:33.061
<b>No matter how much we think
about it, we're getting nowhere.</b>

00:17:34.688 --> 00:17:36.438
<b>Then the conclusion's pretty
obvious, isn't it?</b>

00:17:37.354 --> 00:17:39.314
<b>Screw your nonsense.</b>

00:17:39.688 --> 00:17:41.268
<b>Are you so clever that you
decided to raid an arcade</b>

00:17:41.354 --> 00:17:43.694
<b>on your way to a crime scene?</b>

00:17:44.729 --> 00:17:45.979
<b>Did you have the time do that?</b>

00:17:46.646 --> 00:17:48.846
<b>Aren't they criminals too?</b>

00:17:49.979 --> 00:17:52.649
<b>Gangsters and killers
are the same shit.</b>

00:17:52.896 --> 00:17:55.976
<b>Jeong Tae-seok, what's wrong
with you?</b>

00:17:57.104 --> 00:17:58.194
<b>Hey.</b>

00:18:00.021 --> 00:18:01.401
<b>Are you that desperate
to get promoted?</b>

00:18:06.646 --> 00:18:07.686
<b>Gosh...</b>

00:18:10.146 --> 00:18:12.146
<b>Yes, that's what I'm after.</b>

00:18:13.438 --> 00:18:15.058
<b>It's why I want
to catch the killer.</b>

00:18:19.146 --> 00:18:22.016
<b>The meeting's over, so move it.
Let's get that killer.</b>

00:18:27.688 --> 00:18:29.688
<b>I didn't drink, so I'll drive.</b>

00:18:30.438 --> 00:18:31.478
<b>But, Boss...</b>

00:18:32.188 --> 00:18:33.848
<b>Take the boys and head back.</b>

00:18:34.313 --> 00:18:35.403
<b>Yes, Boss.</b>

00:18:47.479 --> 00:18:49.019
<b>That's correct, Chairman.</b>

00:18:49.563 --> 00:18:52.773
<b>Sang-do may be a bit rash,
but he's a smart man.</b>

00:18:53.479 --> 00:18:55.229
<b>He won't make trouble anymore.</b>

00:18:57.313 --> 00:18:59.193
<b>Yes, don't worry.</b>

00:19:04.563 --> 00:19:06.233
<b>Have a good night.</b>

00:19:33.813 --> 00:19:34.853
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

00:19:35.729 --> 00:19:37.479
<b>The road was slippery.</b>

00:19:47.688 --> 00:19:49.648
<b>It looks fine. You can just go.</b>

00:19:50.021 --> 00:19:51.061
<b>Sorry?</b>

00:19:51.521 --> 00:19:53.191
<b>But I still hit your car.</b>

00:19:53.438 --> 00:19:54.938
<b>It's fine. You can go.</b>

00:19:56.563 --> 00:19:57.983
<b>Are you sure about that?</b>

00:19:58.938 --> 00:20:00.148
<b>Yes, it's fine.</b>

00:20:06.771 --> 00:20:08.401
<b>Son of a bitch!</b>

00:20:25.354 --> 00:20:26.484
<b>Damn it!</b>

00:20:28.938 --> 00:20:30.018
<b>What the hell?</b>

00:20:58.688 --> 00:20:59.808
<b>Who are you?</b>

00:21:01.188 --> 00:21:02.228
<b>Come back here!</b>

00:21:44.896 --> 00:21:46.056
<b>You're all dead!</b>

00:22:12.521 --> 00:22:14.481
<b>You assholes!</b>

00:23:53.563 --> 00:23:54.693
<b>Who's there?</b>

00:24:14.729 --> 00:24:16.349
<b>Sang-do didn't send him.</b>

00:24:18.313 --> 00:24:19.903
<b>I didn't recognize the attacker.</b>

00:24:20.229 --> 00:24:22.309
<b>It was Sang-do, Boss.</b>

00:24:22.396 --> 00:24:24.346
<b>He's not a member of a gang.</b>

00:24:25.104 --> 00:24:27.354
<b>His attack felt purposeless
and empathetic.</b>

00:24:27.979 --> 00:24:29.729
<b>It felt different.</b>

00:24:29.813 --> 00:24:32.653
<b>Who else would try to attack you</b>

00:24:32.729 --> 00:24:34.189
<b>in our line of work?</b>

00:24:34.271 --> 00:24:35.271
<b>Give me that.</b>

00:24:39.563 --> 00:24:41.523
<b>It was too dark
to see properly but...</b>

00:24:41.604 --> 00:24:43.194
<b>WHITE SEDAN,
DAEJEON 23XX</b>

00:24:43.979 --> 00:24:45.729
<b>- Get out!
- Locate the vehicle.</b>

00:24:45.813 --> 00:24:47.733
<b>I told you to be careful,
didn't I?</b>

00:24:47.813 --> 00:24:49.193
<b>We're actually friends.</b>

00:24:51.938 --> 00:24:53.898
<b>Gosh, sorry to bother you.</b>

00:24:54.813 --> 00:24:56.443
<b>The patient looks
damn comfy to me.</b>

00:24:56.521 --> 00:24:57.691
<b>Who are you?</b>

00:24:58.146 --> 00:24:59.726
<b>I brought a box of Red Bulls.</b>

00:25:00.229 --> 00:25:03.099
<b>Anyway, I heard
you were stabbed recently.</b>

00:25:03.854 --> 00:25:05.654
<b>The hospital
reported it to the police.</b>

00:25:06.021 --> 00:25:09.021
<b>Well, you must be
quite embarrassed</b>

00:25:09.979 --> 00:25:11.769
<b>to have been attacked like that.
You're a thug, after all.</b>

00:25:13.521 --> 00:25:16.191
<b>It's not as embarrassing
as being a cop.</b>

00:25:16.646 --> 00:25:18.436
<b>Cops are so incompetent</b>

00:25:18.854 --> 00:25:21.444
<b>that bad things keep happening
to model citizens.</b>

00:25:22.563 --> 00:25:23.653
<b>Unbelievable.</b>

00:25:27.313 --> 00:25:30.023
<b>Right, model citizen,
Jang Dong-su,</b>

00:25:31.188 --> 00:25:33.848
<b>tell me everything
about last night.</b>

00:25:33.938 --> 00:25:35.268
<b>I'll catch him for you.</b>

00:25:36.729 --> 00:25:38.649
<b>I can probably catch him faster.</b>

00:25:38.896 --> 00:25:40.016
<b>Really?</b>

00:25:40.896 --> 00:25:43.056
<b>Jeez. Do you want to bet?</b>

00:25:44.271 --> 00:25:46.731
<b>Spill it, asshole.</b>

00:25:47.813 --> 00:25:49.653
<b>Like I said,
I'll catch him for you.</b>

00:25:52.354 --> 00:25:54.314
<b>Fine. Do you mind?</b>

00:25:58.354 --> 00:26:03.354
<b>I tripped last night
and hurt myself.</b>

00:26:11.646 --> 00:26:13.266
<b>Right, okay.</b>

00:26:14.229 --> 00:26:16.019
<b>You should really
watch your step.</b>

00:26:16.646 --> 00:26:21.056
<b>Unlucky bastards can trip
and fall on multiple knives.</b>

00:27:10.563 --> 00:27:13.653
<b>Jang's car is a black Mercedes
with the number 3849, right?</b>

00:27:17.854 --> 00:27:19.024
<b>Got it, I'll hang up.</b>

00:27:25.854 --> 00:27:27.734
<b>Son of a bitch.</b>

00:27:29.854 --> 00:27:31.604
<b>A rear-end collision.</b>

00:27:33.229 --> 00:27:34.899
<b>White sedan.</b>

00:27:37.021 --> 00:27:39.101
<b>I was right, shithead.</b>

00:27:40.396 --> 00:27:42.266
<b>WISH YOU A FAST RECOVERY,
HUR SANG-DO</b>

00:27:48.271 --> 00:27:51.351
<b>Jeez, look at you.</b>

00:27:52.646 --> 00:27:53.686
<b>Are you okay?</b>

00:27:54.729 --> 00:27:56.269
<b>- Have a seat.
- I'm fine.</b>

00:27:57.479 --> 00:27:59.769
<b>I feel so bad that
I can barely look at you.</b>

00:28:03.771 --> 00:28:05.901
<b>What will happen now?</b>

00:28:06.146 --> 00:28:09.516
<b>You made a mess right after
we signed the contract.</b>

00:28:10.938 --> 00:28:12.148
<b>What would you like me to do?</b>

00:28:15.021 --> 00:28:16.941
<b>A lot of my boys
are cripples now.</b>

00:28:17.688 --> 00:28:19.438
<b>Pay hospital bills
and some compensation.</b>

00:28:19.979 --> 00:28:22.099
<b>and hand over the main store
and also the one in Seongan.</b>

00:28:25.479 --> 00:28:27.769
<b>I'll make sure your boys
are well compensated.</b>

00:28:29.354 --> 00:28:30.354
<b>And the shops?</b>

00:28:31.979 --> 00:28:33.439
<b>Was this your plan all along?</b>

00:28:39.354 --> 00:28:40.444
<b>Dong-su.</b>

00:28:43.688 --> 00:28:45.018
<b>If I gave the order,</b>

00:28:47.646 --> 00:28:48.936
<b>you wouldn't be alive.</b>

00:28:51.146 --> 00:28:52.686
<b>Anyway, think about it.</b>

00:28:53.979 --> 00:28:55.559
<b>I'm curious too, you know.</b>

00:28:56.646 --> 00:28:58.556
<b>Who would mess you up like this?</b>

00:29:00.604 --> 00:29:01.654
<b>See you then.</b>

00:29:02.146 --> 00:29:03.896
<b>So fucking embarrassing!</b>

00:29:03.979 --> 00:29:07.479
<b>A gangster getting stabbed?
I'd just kill myself!</b>

00:29:11.104 --> 00:29:13.984
<b>Trust me and give me
two men on this case.</b>

00:29:14.063 --> 00:29:16.563
<b>I'll catch that guy in one go.</b>

00:29:16.771 --> 00:29:19.311
<b>Why don't you just
go on a vacation?</b>

00:29:20.021 --> 00:29:22.311
<b>I barely have enough men
to run this department,</b>

00:29:22.521 --> 00:29:25.271
<b>so why are you offering
to take someone else's problem?</b>

00:29:25.479 --> 00:29:27.349
<b>Chief, it's a huge case.</b>

00:29:27.479 --> 00:29:29.349
<b>If you close one,
others will get solved as well.</b>

00:29:29.438 --> 00:29:32.268
<b>It will be a long train
of solved cases.</b>

00:29:32.688 --> 00:29:33.978
<b>Piss off!</b>

00:29:38.354 --> 00:29:41.814
<b>We finally have a victim
who survived the attack.</b>

00:29:43.688 --> 00:29:44.938
<b>Did a witness come forward?</b>

00:29:53.771 --> 00:29:54.811
<b>Jang Dong-su.</b>

00:29:56.479 --> 00:29:57.599
<b>What? Jang Dong-su?</b>

00:29:58.896 --> 00:30:01.186
<b>He was stabbed a few days ago.</b>

00:30:01.729 --> 00:30:04.439
<b>A two-hour surgery
barely kept him alive and--</b>

00:30:04.521 --> 00:30:05.601
<b>Listen to yourself.</b>

00:30:05.688 --> 00:30:07.978
<b>Just think about it
for a second.</b>

00:30:08.813 --> 00:30:11.563
<b>What kind of psychotic idiot
would attack a gang leader?</b>

00:30:11.646 --> 00:30:14.016
<b>The killer's not involved
with gangs.</b>

00:30:14.854 --> 00:30:17.564
<b>I'm sure of it.
It's the serial killer!</b>

00:30:17.646 --> 00:30:18.646
<b>Shut it!</b>

00:30:20.938 --> 00:30:24.058
<b>This is a gang problem,
I'll assign it to Unit Two.</b>

00:30:26.188 --> 00:30:28.728
<b>I'm warning you.
Don't get involved.</b>

00:30:29.646 --> 00:30:30.726
<b>Now, get out.</b>

00:30:31.354 --> 00:30:33.734
<b>Go easy on covering for him.</b>

00:30:34.521 --> 00:30:36.651
<b>This isn't the time for that.</b>

00:30:39.563 --> 00:30:40.693
<b>What did you say?</b>

00:30:40.979 --> 00:30:42.099
<b>It's what you've been doing.</b>

00:30:42.729 --> 00:30:43.939
<b>You son of a bitch!</b>

00:30:49.646 --> 00:30:51.146
<b>Let's say you're right.</b>

00:30:52.479 --> 00:30:54.099
<b>But Jang is the victim here.</b>

00:30:54.354 --> 00:30:56.154
<b>You can't arrest a witness</b>

00:30:56.229 --> 00:30:58.189
<b>for not reporting a crime.</b>

00:30:58.271 --> 00:31:00.021
<b>How many crimes
has he committed?</b>

00:31:02.104 --> 00:31:04.604
<b>We need to bring him in
and have him questioned.</b>

00:31:05.146 --> 00:31:06.806
<b>He's pissed off
to say the least.</b>

00:31:07.021 --> 00:31:09.731
<b>If we don't do anything,
he'll kill the killer.</b>

00:31:10.104 --> 00:31:11.774
<b>That'll leave us
with three unsolved cases.</b>

00:31:12.188 --> 00:31:13.768
<b>How can Jang find the killer?</b>

00:31:14.771 --> 00:31:15.981
<b>He's a gangster, not a cop.</b>

00:31:16.146 --> 00:31:19.686
<b>His men have the resources
to find someone in days.</b>

00:31:19.771 --> 00:31:21.101
<b>Also, Jang saw...</b>

00:31:24.813 --> 00:31:26.773
<b>the killer's face.</b>

00:31:34.021 --> 00:31:35.021
<b>Get out.</b>

00:31:36.188 --> 00:31:38.348
<b>You're spewing
a lot of nonsense.</b>

00:31:39.271 --> 00:31:40.311
<b>- Get out!
- Jeez.</b>

00:31:53.688 --> 00:31:56.348
<b>Why don't you talk
to the landlord?</b>

00:31:58.063 --> 00:31:59.153
<b>Jeez!</b>

00:31:59.771 --> 00:32:01.601
<b>What am I supposed to do?</b>

00:32:01.688 --> 00:32:03.808
<b>I need to work
in order to earn money!</b>

00:32:05.438 --> 00:32:07.598
<b>What? Birthday?</b>

00:32:11.271 --> 00:32:13.021
<b>How is that important right now?</b>

00:32:13.479 --> 00:32:15.099
<b>I'm tired as hell!</b>

00:32:15.313 --> 00:32:16.733
<b>I haven't slept in two days,</b>

00:32:16.813 --> 00:32:18.603
<b>so don't nag me
about a kid's birthday!</b>

00:32:19.479 --> 00:32:20.729
<b>It must be your kid's birthday.</b>

00:32:23.146 --> 00:32:24.146
<b>What?</b>

00:32:26.021 --> 00:32:27.811
<b>That goddamn kid you mentioned.</b>

00:32:38.896 --> 00:32:39.936
<b>Give me that.</b>

00:32:45.729 --> 00:32:47.189
<b>Sharp face,</b>

00:32:47.771 --> 00:32:50.441
<b>thin cheeks, an angled chin,</b>

00:32:52.938 --> 00:32:55.058
<b>and a narrow and long nose.</b>

00:32:59.229 --> 00:33:01.809
<b>His lips are big
compared to his nose.</b>

00:33:08.271 --> 00:33:09.901
<b>That's pretty close.</b>

00:33:19.104 --> 00:33:20.734
<b>Then you shouldn't
have had the kid.</b>

00:33:22.604 --> 00:33:23.944
<b>It's not the kid's fault.</b>

00:33:29.646 --> 00:33:31.266
<b>Find him before the cops.</b>

00:33:31.563 --> 00:33:32.773
<b>I understand, Boss.</b>

00:34:13.771 --> 00:34:15.061
<b>Hey, where are we?</b>

00:34:17.063 --> 00:34:18.153
<b>Wait. Who are you?</b>

00:34:55.771 --> 00:34:57.351
<b>Block the door!</b>

00:34:57.438 --> 00:34:58.898
<b>Don't let them come out!</b>

00:35:01.563 --> 00:35:03.693
<b>Thank you for your cooperation.</b>

00:35:06.521 --> 00:35:10.231
<b>We're cracking down
on illegal slot arcades.</b>

00:35:10.479 --> 00:35:12.689
<b>All gamblers should stay put.</b>

00:35:13.479 --> 00:35:14.899
<b>So where's the boss?</b>

00:35:15.896 --> 00:35:17.766
<b>Get him down here!</b>

00:35:23.563 --> 00:35:25.603
<b>Yeah? Hold on.</b>

00:35:30.229 --> 00:35:31.729
<b>Okay, go ahead.</b>

00:35:33.063 --> 00:35:34.853
<b>Jang Dong-su,
that adorable piece of shit.</b>

00:35:34.979 --> 00:35:36.849
<b>He's a scheming bastard.</b>

00:35:37.521 --> 00:35:39.981
<b>He meddled with 63 out
of 97 slot machines.</b>

00:35:40.271 --> 00:35:42.311
<b>- Should I get a warrant today?
- Hold on,</b>

00:35:42.729 --> 00:35:44.099
<b>let me ask him.</b>

00:35:46.021 --> 00:35:48.021
<b>So, should I request a warrant?</b>

00:35:48.563 --> 00:35:49.773
<b>What do you want?</b>

00:35:50.188 --> 00:35:51.518
<b>The one who stabbed you.</b>

00:35:52.438 --> 00:35:55.188
<b>Tell me everything,
and I'll let this one slide.</b>

00:35:56.854 --> 00:35:58.104
<b>What if I don't?</b>

00:36:00.729 --> 00:36:02.439
<b>Since you have my boss
on your side,</b>

00:36:02.521 --> 00:36:04.651
<b>I'm no use to you, is that it?</b>

00:36:06.271 --> 00:36:08.771
<b>Listen, Jang Dong-su.</b>

00:36:09.021 --> 00:36:10.271
<b>The guy who stabbed you</b>

00:36:11.521 --> 00:36:13.021
<b>is a serial killer.</b>

00:36:15.479 --> 00:36:17.019
<b>He's a bit strange though.</b>

00:36:17.854 --> 00:36:19.604
<b>He's different
from other psychos.</b>

00:36:20.396 --> 00:36:21.646
<b>And you're the proof.</b>

00:36:24.604 --> 00:36:25.984
<b>What the hell
are you talking about?</b>

00:36:27.396 --> 00:36:29.976
<b>Why do you think
he messed with you?</b>

00:36:37.771 --> 00:36:41.061
<b>Most psychopaths go after girls</b>

00:36:41.146 --> 00:36:43.056
<b>or people who are weaker
and smaller than they are.</b>

00:36:43.146 --> 00:36:45.016
<b>But the killer
attacks just about anyone.</b>

00:36:46.021 --> 00:36:48.521
<b>If we don't find him soon,
more people will die.</b>

00:36:50.813 --> 00:36:52.853
<b>What the hell's your problem?</b>

00:36:53.854 --> 00:36:56.814
<b>Hand over the information
and do your gangster stuff.</b>

00:36:56.896 --> 00:36:58.346
<b>It's a win-win.</b>

00:36:58.771 --> 00:37:01.231
<b>I'll catch him,
put him on trial,</b>

00:37:01.313 --> 00:37:03.153
<b>and lock him up for good.</b>

00:37:06.271 --> 00:37:07.271
<b>Then what?</b>

00:37:08.188 --> 00:37:10.018
<b>Nothing. That's how it ends.</b>

00:37:12.021 --> 00:37:13.101
<b>That's it?</b>

00:37:14.271 --> 00:37:18.481
<b>When the country's biggest
luxury casino is built</b>

00:37:18.563 --> 00:37:20.983
<b>on the penthouse
of this skyscraper,</b>

00:37:21.354 --> 00:37:23.774
<b>this entire area
surrounding our Zeus building</b>

00:37:23.854 --> 00:37:26.694
<b>will become the hottest spot
in town--</b>

00:37:26.771 --> 00:37:30.521
<b>Cut the crap. I heard
this place's ruined.</b>

00:37:30.938 --> 00:37:32.268
<b>Damn it.</b>

00:37:34.938 --> 00:37:37.098
<b>Everyone who lined up</b>

00:37:37.188 --> 00:37:38.728
<b>for pre-construction units
have left.</b>

00:37:39.354 --> 00:37:43.064
<b>Naturally, investors
are delaying their funding.</b>

00:37:43.979 --> 00:37:47.649
<b>Weird rumors have been flying
since your accident.</b>

00:37:49.021 --> 00:37:51.851
<b>The Cheongju region
is another problem too.</b>

00:37:51.938 --> 00:37:55.018
<b>Sang-do's boys are moving
into our turf.</b>

00:37:56.146 --> 00:37:57.476
<b>What about the punk
who stabbed me?</b>

00:37:58.271 --> 00:38:00.481
<b>We found his car</b>

00:38:00.563 --> 00:38:02.233
<b>on the Sintanjin-bound
national highway.</b>

00:38:02.979 --> 00:38:03.979
<b>His car?</b>

00:38:04.479 --> 00:38:07.059
<b>It was parked at a rest area
for a few days.</b>

00:38:07.271 --> 00:38:08.651
<b>The boys found it.</b>

00:38:08.729 --> 00:38:11.479
<b>- Where is the car now?
- We brought it back.</b>

00:38:12.146 --> 00:38:15.146
<b>Anyway, there was a murder
a few days ago in that area.</b>

00:38:16.021 --> 00:38:19.941
<b>And this. I don't know
if it was dumped or lost,</b>

00:38:20.271 --> 00:38:23.561
<b>but the boys found it
about 3km away from the car.</b>

00:38:29.479 --> 00:38:30.979
<b>Hold onto it.</b>

00:38:31.354 --> 00:38:32.524
<b>Yes, Boss.</b>

00:38:39.229 --> 00:38:41.189
<b>- Hello.
- This is Jang Dong-su.</b>

00:38:45.313 --> 00:38:46.603
<b>What a surprise.</b>

00:38:47.146 --> 00:38:48.936
<b>Do you know
the Sintanjin murder case?</b>

00:38:49.813 --> 00:38:50.903
<b>What about it?</b>

00:38:52.479 --> 00:38:53.599
<b>That bastard did it.</b>

00:38:54.271 --> 00:38:55.311
<b>What?</b>

00:38:58.771 --> 00:39:00.021
<b>How do you know that?</b>

00:39:02.354 --> 00:39:04.444
<b>We found his car in the area.</b>

00:39:08.229 --> 00:39:10.269
<b>I've been doing quite well
lately.</b>

00:39:11.771 --> 00:39:14.061
<b>I got all the way up here
by risking my life.</b>

00:39:14.771 --> 00:39:18.231
<b>Then some random guy comes along
and gets in my way.</b>

00:39:19.479 --> 00:39:22.019
<b>What other choice do I have
other than cutting him down?</b>

00:39:22.396 --> 00:39:23.806
<b>It's not like I can move aside
for him.</b>

00:39:23.896 --> 00:39:27.146
<b>But that psycho
disappeared without a trace</b>

00:39:27.688 --> 00:39:30.228
<b>after walking all over
a gangster's reputation.</b>

00:39:31.063 --> 00:39:32.313
<b>Hey,</b>

00:39:32.563 --> 00:39:35.903
<b>whoever messes with me
has to pay the price.</b>

00:39:37.438 --> 00:39:39.898
<b>Reputation is everything
to a gangster.</b>

00:39:41.938 --> 00:39:47.148
<b>I'll chop him up
and put him on display.</b>

00:39:47.979 --> 00:39:51.519
<b>Are you telling a cop
you'll kill a man?</b>

00:39:52.313 --> 00:39:54.443
<b>We punish people
in ways that the law can't.</b>

00:39:54.646 --> 00:39:57.596
<b>Are you saying a bad guy
will catch another bad guy?</b>

00:39:58.063 --> 00:39:59.103
<b>No.</b>

00:39:59.813 --> 00:40:04.063
<b>Two bad guys will catch
a sicko that's even worse.</b>

00:40:08.771 --> 00:40:09.901
<b>Here's his car key.</b>

00:40:15.479 --> 00:40:17.729
<b>Do you not see me as a cop?</b>

00:40:18.979 --> 00:40:21.689
<b>I can arrest you right away,
you know.</b>

00:40:22.938 --> 00:40:24.348
<b>You won't though. Why?</b>

00:40:25.313 --> 00:40:28.153
<b>Because you want him
more than I do.</b>

00:40:36.729 --> 00:40:40.349
<b>I'll provide manpower
and pay the expenses.</b>

00:40:41.729 --> 00:40:42.979
<b>We'll share information</b>

00:40:44.354 --> 00:40:45.944
<b>and help each other out.</b>

00:40:46.729 --> 00:40:47.809
<b>And the prize?</b>

00:40:48.813 --> 00:40:49.903
<b>Do we split him in half?</b>

00:40:50.396 --> 00:40:52.436
<b>Whoever catches him first
can keep him.</b>

00:40:53.188 --> 00:40:57.058
<b>So if I catch him first,
he'll be punished by the law,</b>

00:40:58.396 --> 00:40:59.896
<b>but if you catch him,
you'll finish him off, right?</b>

00:41:01.188 --> 00:41:02.728
<b>Join the game
if you're confident enough.</b>

00:41:13.896 --> 00:41:14.936
<b>Count me in.</b>

00:41:16.271 --> 00:41:18.231
<b>You'll regret this, you know.</b>

00:41:23.104 --> 00:41:24.194
<b>He's a handsome fellow.</b>

00:41:25.979 --> 00:41:27.099
<b>How old did he seem?</b>

00:41:28.396 --> 00:41:30.056
<b>About mid-30s.</b>

00:41:30.646 --> 00:41:32.766
<b>Rain and darkness
obscured my vision, though.</b>

00:41:33.646 --> 00:41:35.346
<b>Keep in touch using this.</b>

00:41:39.021 --> 00:41:42.601
<b>A gangster and cop join forces
to catch the devil.</b>

00:41:42.688 --> 00:41:45.188
<b>This is interesting!</b>

00:41:55.813 --> 00:41:59.443
<b>A gangster and cop join forces
to catch the devil.</b>

00:41:59.521 --> 00:42:02.101
<b>This is interesting!</b>

00:42:02.771 --> 00:42:03.901
<b>You motherfucker.</b>

00:42:03.979 --> 00:42:05.399
<b>We're in the same boat.</b>

00:42:05.479 --> 00:42:07.309
<b>I'd be a fool
not to have insurance.</b>

00:42:08.063 --> 00:42:10.063
<b>It's not like
we can draft a contract, right?</b>

00:42:14.563 --> 00:42:18.313
<b>So you went to all the trouble
to record me?</b>

00:42:21.604 --> 00:42:23.234
<b>Fuck!</b>

00:42:27.354 --> 00:42:30.604
<b>Did you really think
you could have leverage over me?</b>

00:42:33.396 --> 00:42:35.516
<b>This is why I don't trust cops.</b>

00:42:45.646 --> 00:42:46.896
<b>Unbelievable.</b>

00:42:51.146 --> 00:42:52.976
<b>Just because I'm being lenient</b>

00:42:53.063 --> 00:42:54.983
<b>doesn't mean
you can walk all over me.</b>

00:42:55.563 --> 00:42:56.813
<b>Listen, you bastard.</b>

00:42:57.146 --> 00:43:01.226
<b>When this is over,
I'll lock you up first, asshole!</b>

00:43:06.146 --> 00:43:07.936
<b>He stabbed Jang Dong-su too</b>

00:43:08.354 --> 00:43:10.064
<b>and is the culprit
behind the Sintanjin case.</b>

00:43:10.313 --> 00:43:11.773
<b>So what does this mean?</b>

00:43:12.771 --> 00:43:16.401
<b>If things go as planned,
we can close five cases at once.</b>

00:43:19.313 --> 00:43:21.273
<b>Mid-30s, male, average height.</b>

00:43:21.438 --> 00:43:24.268
<b>Judging from his pattern,
he only kills at night.</b>

00:43:24.521 --> 00:43:27.651
<b>He doesn't care whom he kills
and he only uses a knife.</b>

00:43:28.021 --> 00:43:29.151
<b>It's one or the other.</b>

00:43:29.688 --> 00:43:32.268
<b>He has an obsession
or he's always prepared.</b>

00:43:33.729 --> 00:43:35.099
<b>There are no other clues so far.</b>

00:43:40.729 --> 00:43:42.269
<b>I made a deal with
Detective Jeong.</b>

00:43:42.521 --> 00:43:43.651
<b>We'll catch him together.</b>

00:43:43.979 --> 00:43:45.269
<b>Obviously,
we won't tell the others.</b>

00:43:45.354 --> 00:43:46.904
<b>How can we trust cops?</b>

00:43:46.979 --> 00:43:48.939
<b>How can we trust gangsters?</b>

00:43:49.021 --> 00:43:50.151
<b>Who said anything about trust?</b>

00:43:50.729 --> 00:43:52.729
<b>We need manpower
to catch the killer</b>

00:43:52.979 --> 00:43:55.269
<b>and this isn't a case
we can handle ourselves.</b>

00:43:55.354 --> 00:43:57.984
<b>- Let's get the others involved.
- Then what?</b>

00:43:58.063 --> 00:43:59.983
<b>The Major Case Squad
will take over,</b>

00:44:00.063 --> 00:44:03.353
<b>get the media involved,
and have all the glory.</b>

00:44:03.563 --> 00:44:06.693
<b>That's not all.
The Chief is protecting Jang,</b>

00:44:06.771 --> 00:44:09.191
<b>so this is the only way
to solve this case.</b>

00:44:09.729 --> 00:44:12.099
<b>The Chief will get into trouble too.</b>

00:44:12.521 --> 00:44:16.021
<b>Jang has seen his face
and has his car.</b>

00:44:16.104 --> 00:44:18.154
<b>We can't only rely
on the drawing.</b>

00:44:18.604 --> 00:44:20.354
<b>We need fingerprints and DNA.</b>

00:44:20.729 --> 00:44:23.649
<b>We'll help the gangsters
find the killer</b>

00:44:23.729 --> 00:44:25.479
<b>and move in to make the arrest.</b>

00:44:25.854 --> 00:44:29.564
<b>I'll use the cops
and throw them away afterward.</b>

00:44:40.479 --> 00:44:42.269
<b>We're all
tax-paying citizen too.</b>

00:44:43.021 --> 00:44:45.311
<b>Let's get support
from the cops for once.</b>

00:44:50.729 --> 00:44:53.439
<b>On the outside, it looks like
an abandoned cold store,</b>

00:44:53.854 --> 00:44:56.524
<b>but thousands of slot machines
are built here</b>

00:44:56.604 --> 00:44:58.104
<b>and distributed
all over the country.</b>

00:44:58.188 --> 00:44:59.348
<b>Sons of bitches.</b>

00:45:06.188 --> 00:45:07.898
<b>Jeez.</b>

00:45:08.438 --> 00:45:09.848
<b>I'm sure there will be
something to find.</b>

00:45:09.938 --> 00:45:13.438
<b>Probably his hair, fingerprint,
or even traces of his fart.</b>

00:45:13.896 --> 00:45:16.516
<b>We have to find something
no matter what.</b>

00:45:16.896 --> 00:45:18.346
<b>We'll comb every inch of it.</b>

00:45:18.479 --> 00:45:19.939
<b>Okay, let's begin.</b>

00:45:21.479 --> 00:45:23.979
<b>We'll leave all the grunt work to Jang</b>

00:45:24.354 --> 00:45:26.984
<b>and go through the cases
that have happened so far.</b>

00:45:27.479 --> 00:45:30.149
<b>This is the security footage
from the highway.</b>

00:45:30.479 --> 00:45:31.599
<b>Let's go over his pattern.</b>

00:45:31.688 --> 00:45:35.268
<b>He used a vehicle
in all the murders so far.</b>

00:45:35.688 --> 00:45:37.898
<b>He's always on the move
which makes him harder to catch.</b>

00:45:39.396 --> 00:45:42.056
<b>We know of four open cases,
but there has to be more.</b>

00:45:42.229 --> 00:45:44.439
<b>Even when dealing
with any other cases,</b>

00:45:44.521 --> 00:45:46.811
<b>always consider the possibility
of serial killings.</b>

00:45:47.021 --> 00:45:48.651
<b>If you find anything,
report to me right away.</b>

00:45:49.146 --> 00:45:50.646
<b>He's a ticking time bomb.</b>

00:45:51.229 --> 00:45:54.309
<b>He could pop up anywhere,
so check cases in other areas.</b>

00:45:54.771 --> 00:45:56.271
<b>Also, make sure you're discreet.</b>

00:46:04.979 --> 00:46:07.649
<b>We'll lock up the gangsters
once the case is over.</b>

00:46:07.979 --> 00:46:09.059
<b>Nice, right?</b>

00:46:11.229 --> 00:46:13.399
<b>Ultimately, it's up to us
to catch the killer.</b>

00:46:15.063 --> 00:46:17.063
<b>Before we do though,
let's take care of Sang-do.</b>

00:47:14.479 --> 00:47:15.519
<b>Son of a bitch!</b>

00:47:20.813 --> 00:47:21.903
<b>Are you insane?</b>

00:47:22.354 --> 00:47:23.854
<b>What are you doing here?</b>

00:47:25.229 --> 00:47:26.599
<b>What the hell do you think?</b>

00:47:27.396 --> 00:47:28.556
<b>I was waiting for you.</b>

00:47:30.188 --> 00:47:31.518
<b>I think you broke my back.</b>

00:47:31.604 --> 00:47:33.524
<b>You shouldn't have surprised me
like that.</b>

00:47:33.604 --> 00:47:34.904
<b>I almost had a heart attack.</b>

00:47:36.146 --> 00:47:37.186
<b>Give me some.</b>

00:47:42.646 --> 00:47:45.266
<b>- Nice.
- Could you look into this?</b>

00:47:45.854 --> 00:47:47.734
<b>- It's urgent.
- What is it?</b>

00:47:48.854 --> 00:47:52.194
<b>Nothing special.
I found some hair and blood.</b>

00:47:52.563 --> 00:47:54.773
<b>- Please look into them.
- Jeong Tae-seok.</b>

00:47:56.604 --> 00:47:58.944
<b>What's wrong with you?
This isn't like you.</b>

00:47:59.979 --> 00:48:01.059
<b>What isn't like me?</b>

00:48:02.313 --> 00:48:04.353
<b>It's a filthy world.</b>

00:48:05.813 --> 00:48:07.653
<b>I ought to get
my hands dirty too.</b>

00:48:07.729 --> 00:48:09.059
<b>Right, it is filthy.</b>

00:48:25.021 --> 00:48:26.351
<b>He's a weird one.</b>

00:48:27.646 --> 00:48:29.436
<b>He left the weapon
for us to see.</b>

00:48:31.063 --> 00:48:33.483
<b>"Killer is still at large
but cops are clueless.</b>

00:48:34.313 --> 00:48:36.193
<b>Incompetent cops."</b>

00:48:37.729 --> 00:48:41.979
<b>And now,
even a gang leader is dead.</b>

00:48:42.729 --> 00:48:44.439
<b>What will you do?</b>

00:48:45.688 --> 00:48:46.848
<b>What should we do about this?</b>

00:48:47.229 --> 00:48:49.599
<b>Look at you all.
Cat got your tongue?</b>

00:48:49.979 --> 00:48:51.349
<b>The Hur Sang-do case...</b>

00:48:52.313 --> 00:48:55.153
<b>will be assigned to Unit Two

00:48:55.563 --> 00:48:57.023
<b>Do you still not get it?</b>

00:48:57.563 --> 00:48:59.943
<b>Stop staring at the monitor</b>

00:49:00.854 --> 00:49:01.904
<b>and hit the streets.</b>

00:49:02.771 --> 00:49:04.021
<b>Right now!</b>

00:49:05.563 --> 00:49:08.193
<b>I don't care if it's dog crap,</b>

00:49:08.271 --> 00:49:09.981
<b>search and investigate whatever
will help solve the case!</b>

00:49:11.104 --> 00:49:13.854
<b>At least try to look
like you give a damn!</b>

00:49:14.104 --> 00:49:15.194
<b>Hold your heads high!</b>

00:49:15.521 --> 00:49:16.521
<b>Yeah, tell me.</b>

00:49:16.604 --> 00:49:18.774
<b>Do you have a death wish?</b>

00:49:19.104 --> 00:49:21.234
<b>- What is it?
- You said it's nothing special.</b>

00:49:21.729 --> 00:49:23.099
<b>I just got the results
on the samples.</b>

00:49:23.938 --> 00:49:26.478
<b>- I don't believe this.
- What is it? Tell me.</b>

00:49:26.854 --> 00:49:29.604
<b>DNA of the recent
South Chungcheong murder victims</b>

00:49:29.688 --> 00:49:31.558
<b>were detected in the samples.</b>

<b>Really?</b>

00:49:34.521 --> 00:49:35.651
<b>Is that it?</b>

00:49:36.104 --> 00:49:37.654
<b>Was there any unidentified DNA?</b>

00:49:37.729 --> 00:49:39.899
<b>- None.
- That doesn't make sense.</b>

00:49:40.521 --> 00:49:41.601
<b>Did you run the tests properly?</b>

00:49:41.688 --> 00:49:44.478
<b>There was no one else's
but that's not the issue.</b>

00:49:44.563 --> 00:49:47.103
<b>- Something big happened.
- Hold on a second.</b>

00:49:50.938 --> 00:49:51.938
<b>Go ahead.</b>

<b>DNA of the truck driver

<b>What?</b>

<b>It means one person did it all.</b>

00:50:02.063 --> 00:50:05.273
<b>It will be officially classified

<b>Aren't you?</b>

<b>Tell me, asshole.</b>

<b>Did you kill Hur Sang-do?</b>

00:51:17.146 --> 00:51:18.396
<b>Yes, I killed him.</b>

<b>I blame myself

<b>Got it?</b>

00:51:44.688 --> 00:51:45.728

so get going.</b>

01:02:36.354 --> 01:02:39.024
<b>A kidnapping case?
How is that important right now?</b>

01:02:39.229 --> 01:02:41.149
<b>We have
a serial killer to catch.</b>

01:02:41.229 --> 01:02:42.349
<b>That's enough!</b>

01:02:45.813 --> 01:02:46.903
<b>Hey.</b>

01:02:48.938 --> 01:02:51.598
<b>Can't you see that
Major Case Squad is here?</b>

01:02:52.771 --> 01:02:55.851
<b>They're working with Unit One,
so take care of this.</b>

01:02:59.438 --> 01:03:03.688
<b>I told you from the start
that this was a serial murder.</b>

01:03:04.354 --> 01:03:06.904
<b>But now Major Case Squad
and Unit One have taken over.</b>

01:03:07.313 --> 01:03:08.903
<b>What the hell
do they know anyway?</b>

01:03:09.771 --> 01:03:11.561
<b>They're clueless jerks!</b>

01:03:12.188 --> 01:03:14.598
<b>You shithead.
What did you just say?</b>

01:03:14.688 --> 01:03:15.938
<b>Shut up!</b>

01:03:19.354 --> 01:03:20.354
<b>Tae-seok.</b>

01:03:21.229 --> 01:03:22.479
<b>You insisted
it was serial killing</b>

01:03:22.563 --> 01:03:23.653
<b>without any evidence.</b>

01:03:24.229 --> 01:03:26.479
<b>There was no evidence
or even a witness.</b>

01:03:26.729 --> 01:03:27.769
<b>If you were so confident,</b>

01:03:27.854 --> 01:03:29.154
<b>you should have caught him
already.</b>

01:03:32.979 --> 01:03:34.019
<b>Damn it.</b>

01:03:42.771 --> 01:03:45.311
<b>The victim was a prolific CEO.</b>

01:03:50.438 --> 01:03:51.478
<b>Tae-seok.</b>

01:03:54.146 --> 01:03:55.766
<b>You'll find the killer if you
look into his acquaintances,</b>

01:03:55.854 --> 01:03:56.854
<b>so get on it.</b>

01:03:59.729 --> 01:04:02.599
<b>Did something happen
while you were with Jang?</b>

01:04:03.563 --> 01:04:05.273
<b>What's with all the scars?</b>

01:04:06.021 --> 01:04:07.191
<b>Something happened, right?</b>

01:04:09.021 --> 01:04:11.021
<b>Cut the bullshit.</b>

01:04:13.104 --> 01:04:15.484
<b>Ask his colleagues
about the women in his life.</b>

01:04:16.979 --> 01:04:18.809
<b>How many times does this make?</b>

01:04:19.438 --> 01:04:21.438
<b>Why do you keep changing
the meeting spot?</b>

01:04:22.021 --> 01:04:23.561
<b>Is he even alive?</b>

01:04:24.146 --> 01:04:26.646
<b>If you want the money,
put him on the phone!</b>

01:04:29.063 --> 01:04:30.603
<b>This is the last time.</b>

01:04:30.729 --> 01:04:32.349
<b>Be at Jeil Snack Bar
in Wolmyeong-dong.</b>

01:04:32.979 --> 01:04:34.019
<b>Come right now.</b>

01:04:41.271 --> 01:04:44.351
<b>What are you doing?
Go inside already.</b>

01:04:44.604 --> 01:04:46.944
<b>Did you come by
to drop off the bag?</b>

01:04:47.438 --> 01:04:48.898
<b>- Yes.
- Please leave it with me.</b>

01:04:50.854 --> 01:04:53.694
<b>Why is she handing her the cash?</b>

01:04:57.521 --> 01:04:58.731
<b>What the hell.</b>

01:04:59.729 --> 01:05:03.809
<b>Tell the world you're here
with cops, why don't you?</b>

01:05:11.271 --> 01:05:13.811
<b>Hey. Who's that on the roof?</b>

01:05:14.438 --> 01:05:15.728
<b>It's him. He's on the roof!</b>

01:05:16.063 --> 01:05:18.313
<b>Dong-cheol, he's headed north!</b>

01:05:18.396 --> 01:05:19.476
<b>Where is he?</b>

01:05:21.271 --> 01:05:22.981
<b>Sun-ho, lure him
into the main street!</b>

01:05:23.063 --> 01:05:24.193
<b>Hey!</b>

01:05:25.063 --> 01:05:27.103
<b>- Where the hell were you?
- Hey, he's moving away!</b>

01:05:27.354 --> 01:05:29.154
<b>Sun-ho, cut him off!</b>

01:05:29.229 --> 01:05:30.229
<b>Stop!</b>

01:05:31.646 --> 01:05:34.436
<b>- I don't see him!
- What? He's right there!</b>

01:05:34.521 --> 01:05:37.981
<b>- The main street!
- Sun-ho, where the hell are you?</b>

01:05:41.979 --> 01:05:43.649
<b>Stop, you bastard!</b>

01:05:47.938 --> 01:05:49.058
<b>Shit, he's bloody fast.</b>

01:05:52.438 --> 01:05:53.728
<b>Stop right there!</b>

01:05:57.104 --> 01:05:59.064
<b>- I'll head down!
- Hurry!</b>

01:06:01.854 --> 01:06:03.314
<b>I don't see him from here!</b>

01:06:03.396 --> 01:06:05.516
<b>- You're dead meat.
- Where did he go?</b>

01:06:06.438 --> 01:06:07.598
<b>Catch up when you can.</b>

01:06:08.021 --> 01:06:10.151
<b>Up the stairs! Now!</b>

01:06:11.188 --> 01:06:12.268
<b>Freeze!</b>

01:06:15.354 --> 01:06:17.354
<b>He just turned the corner.
Block him from the front!</b>

01:06:17.438 --> 01:06:18.518
<b>Which way did he go?</b>

01:06:21.479 --> 01:06:22.599
<b>Over there. That way!</b>

01:06:24.813 --> 01:06:25.943
<b>Go that way!</b>

01:06:36.896 --> 01:06:38.896
<b>Why did you take the bag</b>

01:06:38.979 --> 01:06:40.519
<b>when you don't know
what's inside?</b>

01:06:41.646 --> 01:06:44.476
<b>Why are you shouting at me?
I didn't do anything wrong.</b>

01:06:44.729 --> 01:06:46.849
<b>Someone asked me to take it.</b>

01:06:47.604 --> 01:06:48.944
<b>Who asked you?</b>

01:06:49.354 --> 01:06:51.904
<b>Tell us
or we'll have you arrested.</b>

01:06:51.979 --> 01:06:53.729
<b>I've never seen him before.</b>

01:06:53.813 --> 01:06:57.483
<b>He ate alone and asked me
to take the bag for him.</b>

01:06:59.313 --> 01:07:00.813
<b>He gave me 20 dollars.</b>

01:07:08.521 --> 01:07:09.691
<b>What did he look like?</b>

01:07:10.271 --> 01:07:12.811
<b>Well, he looked quite average.</b>

01:07:13.313 --> 01:07:14.443
<b>Did he only eat food here?</b>

01:07:16.438 --> 01:07:18.558
<b>He drank a bottle of soju too!</b>

01:07:21.563 --> 01:07:22.903
<b>Where's the bottle?</b>

01:07:23.521 --> 01:07:26.441
<b>The labels differ
depending on the brand,</b>

01:07:26.521 --> 01:07:29.191
<b>but they come in
the same bottle.</b>

01:07:30.021 --> 01:07:31.731
<b>Have fun searching.</b>

01:07:32.229 --> 01:07:33.849
<b>You've got to be kidding me.</b>

01:07:38.604 --> 01:07:40.064
<b>- Dong-cheol!
- Yes?</b>

01:07:40.438 --> 01:07:41.688
<b>Just check the relevant brand.</b>

01:07:41.771 --> 01:07:43.351
<b>- It's not--
- Just the relevant brand!</b>

01:07:43.438 --> 01:07:44.898
<b>This is unbelievable!</b>

01:07:45.063 --> 01:07:46.903
<b>All the bottles are the same!</b>

01:07:50.188 --> 01:07:51.688
<b>There's no need
to work so hard, you know.</b>

01:07:52.438 --> 01:07:53.518
<b>Are you serious?</b>

01:07:56.688 --> 01:07:58.938
<b>What about
the steering wheel cover?</b>

01:07:59.854 --> 01:08:01.354
<b>The result will come out today
at the earliest.</b>

01:08:03.146 --> 01:08:07.186
<b>That's why I'll only charge
two million won per machine.</b>

01:08:08.146 --> 01:08:09.146
<b>Thank you.</b>

01:08:09.271 --> 01:08:11.351
<b>I'll send the technicians
if you need them.</b>

01:08:11.479 --> 01:08:14.059
<b>Isn't that too cheap, Mr. Jang?</b>

01:08:14.521 --> 01:08:16.771
<b>Of course, your generosity</b>

01:08:17.521 --> 01:08:19.521
<b>will make us very happy indeed.</b>

01:08:20.521 --> 01:08:24.691
<b>I don't know if I should take
the good deals he offers though.</b>

01:08:24.854 --> 01:08:26.694
<b>Look what happened to Sang-do.</b>

01:08:28.188 --> 01:08:29.598
<b>Watch out, everyone.</b>

01:08:29.813 --> 01:08:32.653
<b>After Dong-su got stabbed,
Sang-do was killed,</b>

01:08:32.729 --> 01:08:35.599
<b>and his lackey disappeared too.</b>

01:08:36.354 --> 01:08:38.154
<b>Just shut up and eat, will you?</b>

01:09:03.646 --> 01:09:04.806
<b>What brings you by?</b>

01:09:06.688 --> 01:09:07.938
<b>Look for this guy first.</b>

01:09:10.396 --> 01:09:11.936
<b>I found an odd fingerprint.</b>

01:09:13.271 --> 01:09:14.981
<b>I don't know if it's damaged.</b>

01:09:15.479 --> 01:09:17.189
<b>He could've put something on
his fingers on purpose.</b>

01:09:17.646 --> 01:09:19.476
<b>I found him with the partial
prints he left behind.</b>

01:09:19.896 --> 01:09:21.096
<b>He's actually a missing person.</b>

01:09:21.729 --> 01:09:24.059
<b>His print was found
on the steering wheel cover too.</b>

01:09:26.146 --> 01:09:28.346
<b>He hasn't come home
in about three months.</b>

01:09:28.438 --> 01:09:29.648
<b>Did he say where he was going?</b>

01:09:29.729 --> 01:09:32.939
<b>When he's off on a job,
he'd be away for a month.</b>

01:09:33.313 --> 01:09:35.063
<b>He's away quite a while
this time though.</b>

01:09:35.313 --> 01:09:37.443
<b>I reported it thinking
something had happened to him.</b>

01:09:37.979 --> 01:09:39.189
<b>Did he make any trouble?</b>

01:09:39.646 --> 01:09:42.896
<b>No, not at all.
He never missed his rent</b>

01:09:42.979 --> 01:09:47.599
<b>and never drank any alcohol.
He's a faithful Christian too.</b>

01:09:48.188 --> 01:09:49.768
<b>He lives a good, clean life.</b>

01:09:59.104 --> 01:10:01.854
<b>BASIS OF MANKIND
WHO RAISED A MONSTER?</b>

01:10:01.938 --> 01:10:04.648
<b>NIGHT DARKER THAN DEATH
SACRED VIOLENCE</b>

01:10:20.729 --> 01:10:22.229
<b>I found an odd fingerprint.</b>

01:10:22.771 --> 01:10:24.481
<b>I don't know if it's damaged.</b>

01:10:24.938 --> 01:10:26.648
<b>He could've put something on
his fingers on purpose.</b>

01:11:02.729 --> 01:11:04.479
<b>It's 017-684-2784!</b>

01:11:04.854 --> 01:11:06.524
<b>Do a background check
on that number.</b>

01:11:07.438 --> 01:11:09.268
<b>Also, the recording of
the kidnapper's voice.</b>

01:11:09.354 --> 01:11:11.654
<b>Send it to me right away.
Right now!</b>

01:11:15.146 --> 01:11:17.936
<b>I heard you paid a ton
for Sang-do's funeral.</b>

01:11:18.354 --> 01:11:21.734
<b>Isn't Dong-su one loyal guy?</b>

01:11:22.729 --> 01:11:24.559
<b>I hope you
show me the same courtesy.</b>

01:11:28.646 --> 01:11:30.556
<b>Didn't I tell you to just eat?</b>

01:11:30.646 --> 01:11:33.306
<b>You talk too much.</b>

01:11:34.521 --> 01:11:37.811
<b>Why are you ruining
this nice lunch?</b>

01:11:38.188 --> 01:11:41.308
<b>I'm looking out
for your fucking interests.</b>

01:11:43.646 --> 01:11:44.846
<b>Just eat your food!</b>

01:11:51.354 --> 01:11:52.734
<b>Please continue.</b>

01:11:54.438 --> 01:11:56.438
<b>I sent you a photo,
so check it right away.</b>

01:11:56.813 --> 01:11:57.903
<b>Also, listen to this.</b>

01:12:00.771 --> 01:12:01.851
<b>This is the last time.</b>

01:12:03.021 --> 01:12:04.771
<b>Be at Jeil Snack Bar
in Wolmyeong-dong.</b>

01:12:05.146 --> 01:12:06.016
<b>Come right now.</b>

01:12:07.521 --> 01:12:08.561
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

01:12:09.521 --> 01:12:11.271
<b>The road was slippery.</b>

01:12:12.188 --> 01:12:14.018
<b>But I still hit your car.</b>

01:12:23.438 --> 01:12:25.648
<b>Name, Kang Gyeong-ho. Age, 35.</b>

01:12:26.479 --> 01:12:29.479
<b>He was abused by his father
and grew up in an orphanage.</b>

01:12:29.646 --> 01:12:30.806
<b>He has no priors.</b>

01:12:30.896 --> 01:12:33.726
<b>He calls his 70-year-old mother
everyday</b>

01:12:33.813 --> 01:12:35.233
<b>although both use
unlicensed phones.</b>

01:12:35.313 --> 01:12:37.103
<b>Until August, his calls were</b>

01:12:37.188 --> 01:12:38.688
<b>mainly from
Chungcheong Province,</b>

01:12:38.896 --> 01:12:42.806
<b>but he's been calling from
all over the country since then.</b>

01:12:42.896 --> 01:12:47.146
<b>We traced his calls
and they were mainly from Ansan,</b>

01:12:47.479 --> 01:12:49.559
<b>mostly from this district.</b>

01:12:49.854 --> 01:12:51.274
<b>- Daegyeong-dong?
- That's right.</b>

01:12:51.354 --> 01:12:52.904
<b>There are a few colleges,</b>

01:12:52.979 --> 01:12:55.269
<b>so tons of cheap rooms,
apartments,</b>

01:12:55.354 --> 01:12:58.734
<b>and thousands of old houses
are in the neighborhood.</b>

01:12:58.813 --> 01:13:01.153
<b>What a hassle.</b>

01:13:01.229 --> 01:13:02.689
<b>Which means,</b>

01:13:03.479 --> 01:13:06.599
<b>he hid here after stabbing Jang.</b>

01:13:06.688 --> 01:13:09.268
<b>You son of a bitch.
Where are your manners?</b>

01:13:09.521 --> 01:13:11.521
<b>Jang? Don't address him
like he's your friend, asshole.</b>

01:13:11.604 --> 01:13:13.064
<b>You fucking gangster.</b>

01:13:14.104 --> 01:13:16.564
<b>You cops are no different.</b>

01:13:18.771 --> 01:13:20.021
<b>Motherfucker!</b>

01:13:20.479 --> 01:13:22.479
<b>- Damn it!
- Let go of me!</b>

01:13:25.979 --> 01:13:27.309
<b>Do you want to die?</b>

01:13:30.771 --> 01:13:31.941
<b>Come here.</b>

01:13:41.188 --> 01:13:42.188
<b>Guys.</b>

01:13:43.729 --> 01:13:45.059
<b>If we don't catch him,</b>

01:13:45.979 --> 01:13:48.059
<b>we're all fucked,
don't you know that?</b>

01:13:51.646 --> 01:13:53.266
<b>We're in the same boat now,</b>

01:13:54.313 --> 01:13:57.193
<b>so let's see this through
no matter what.</b>

01:13:58.813 --> 01:13:59.943
<b>Let's just do it, all right?</b>

01:14:23.021 --> 01:14:25.481
<b>- Did you all receive the photo?
- Yes, Boss!</b>

01:14:25.979 --> 01:14:28.899
<b>As of this moment,
you have one single mission.</b>

01:14:30.104 --> 01:14:32.854
<b>Find this fucker at all costs.</b>

01:14:32.938 --> 01:14:33.978
<b>- Yes, Boss!
- Yes, Boss!</b>

01:14:35.438 --> 01:14:37.268
<b>Keep a low profile,</b>

01:14:37.771 --> 01:14:39.901
<b>and if you see anyone
who resembles him,</b>

01:14:40.354 --> 01:14:43.314
<b>call your superiors at once.</b>

01:14:44.396 --> 01:14:45.976
<b>There will be
five of you in a team.</b>

01:14:46.646 --> 01:14:48.476
<b>The team leader will update us
every eight hours,</b>

01:14:48.563 --> 01:14:49.773
<b>three times a day.</b>

01:15:02.813 --> 01:15:04.483
<b>Centering on Daegyeong-dong,</b>

<b>search your designated areas

01:15:09.354 --> 01:15:12.654
<b>Check cheap motels,

01:33:59.104 --> 01:34:02.484
<b>However, his current

01:34:05.646 --> 01:34:06.896
<b>This is all your doing, isn't it?</b>

01:34:08.646 --> 01:34:09.686
<b>No.</b>

01:34:09.771 --> 01:34:12.731
<b>You convinced the world
that he's the killer,</b>

01:34:13.563 --> 01:34:14.523
<b>but now there's no evidence?</b>

01:34:14.604 --> 01:34:17.234
<b>Everything we have on him
is circumstantial.</b>

01:34:18.104 --> 01:34:19.944
<b>Nothing directly ties him
to the murders.</b>

01:34:20.021 --> 01:34:21.731
<b>Even if I were the judge,</b>

01:34:21.813 --> 01:34:23.903
<b>I wouldn't
give him the death penalty.</b>

01:34:28.229 --> 01:34:29.939
<b>- What's this?
- A knife.</b>

01:34:30.604 --> 01:34:33.984
<b>Yes, one you used
to murder all those people.</b>

01:34:36.646 --> 01:34:38.096
<b>What has been
your concept in life?</b>

01:34:38.979 --> 01:34:41.559
<b>I just can't figure you out.
Do you know why?</b>

01:34:43.563 --> 01:34:45.063
<b>It's because you're not human.</b>

01:34:45.479 --> 01:34:47.019
<b>Then what's yours?</b>

01:34:49.271 --> 01:34:51.981
<b>A good cop? A model citizen?</b>

01:34:53.813 --> 01:34:55.023
<b>You can't answer me, can you?</b>

01:34:55.813 --> 01:34:58.353
<b>Who lives their life
by following a concept?</b>

01:34:59.438 --> 01:35:02.438
<b>We live because we do.</b>

01:35:05.521 --> 01:35:07.311
<b>I wore gloves for my first kill,</b>

01:35:07.688 --> 01:35:10.648
<b>but I couldn't grip
anything properly with them on.</b>

01:35:11.188 --> 01:35:13.058
<b>Each stab should
always be clean.</b>

01:35:14.854 --> 01:35:16.564
<b>That feeling when it goes in?</b>

01:35:17.271 --> 01:35:19.311
<b>You can feel it
from the tips of your fingers.</b>

01:35:20.521 --> 01:35:22.311
<b>I guess
it's something like that.</b>

01:35:24.229 --> 01:35:25.439
<b>And these photos?</b>

01:35:37.438 --> 01:35:38.518
<b>What is it?</b>

01:35:39.313 --> 01:35:41.103
<b>The order's all wrong.</b>

01:35:44.146 --> 01:35:47.096
<b>Besides, how can you say
that these are mine?</b>

01:35:49.146 --> 01:35:52.806
<b>And even if I get
the death penalty,</b>

01:35:54.188 --> 01:35:55.598
<b>you know I won't die.</b>

01:35:56.646 --> 01:35:57.726
<b>You little bastard.</b>

01:35:58.438 --> 01:35:59.848
<b>- I'll kill you!.
- Hey, stop!</b>

01:35:59.938 --> 01:36:00.978
<b>Stop it!</b>

01:36:01.063 --> 01:36:03.733
<b>- Come here. I'll kill you!
- Stop it!</b>

01:36:03.813 --> 01:36:05.313
<b>Don't do it!</b>

01:36:08.646 --> 01:36:12.396
<b>If you sentence me to death
without proper evidence,</b>

01:36:14.021 --> 01:36:15.771
<b>then that's murder.</b>

01:36:16.229 --> 01:36:20.899
<b>The real devils are those who
commit crimes with kind faces.</b>

01:36:21.771 --> 01:36:24.401
<b>Think about it as creators
and enforcers of the law.</b>

01:36:24.479 --> 01:36:26.769
<b>Do you really have that right?</b>

01:36:28.146 --> 01:36:29.846
<b>If you're innocent,</b>

01:36:31.479 --> 01:36:33.519
<b>then I am too.</b>

01:36:43.729 --> 01:36:45.479
<b>Did you state that
you've never seen this knife?</b>

01:36:48.021 --> 01:36:49.061
<b>I did.</b>

01:36:49.146 --> 01:36:53.096
<b>This knife was used
to kill five victims</b>

01:36:53.354 --> 01:36:55.484
<b>between July
and September of 2005.</b>

01:36:55.563 --> 01:36:56.983
<b>Objection, Your Honor.</b>

01:36:57.354 --> 01:36:59.484
<b>The prosecution has not provided
any concrete link</b>

<b>between the knife

01:37:03.313 --> 01:37:05.693
<b>It cannot be concluded
that the knife belonged to him.</b>

01:37:05.771 --> 01:37:06.811
<b>Yes, you're right.</b>

01:37:08.229 --> 01:37:10.479
<b>This knife has nothing to do
with the defendant...</b>

01:37:11.188 --> 01:37:12.518
<b>at least until now.</b>

01:37:13.646 --> 01:37:18.056
<b>Your Honor, we'd like

<b>You've got balls showing

<b>Damn, you look terrible.</b>

01:38:01.771 --> 01:38:05.811
<b>We pay tax so that you can

01:38:05.896 --> 01:38:08.556
<b>That's how the law is.</b>

01:38:09.313 --> 01:38:11.853
<b>It arrests people

01:38:11.938 --> 01:38:15.188
<b>but it also fucking protects us.
That's what it's there for.</b>

01:38:15.271 --> 01:38:18.271
<b>Shut the fuck up.
You should've let me kill him!</b>

01:38:22.688 --> 01:38:25.478
<b>You're my last resort.</b>

01:38:26.188 --> 01:38:29.438
<b>Let's use the law

01:38:31.979 --> 01:38:33.479
<b>Stop your bullshit.</b>

01:38:41.771 --> 01:38:42.811
<b>Turn yourself in.</b>

01:38:43.063 --> 01:38:45.733
<b>Are you out

01:38:49.521 --> 01:38:52.191
<b>- Did you kill Hur Sang-do?
- Yes, I did.</b>

01:38:53.938 --> 01:38:56.398
<b>- Yes, I did.
- Bastard!</b>

01:38:57.521 --> 01:39:00.851
<b>Once this goes public,

01:39:01.313 --> 01:39:04.653
<b>Don't force me to use this.
All right?</b>

01:39:05.646 --> 01:39:06.846
<b>Surrender and become a witness.</b>

01:39:07.438 --> 01:39:08.768
<b>You're the only witness.</b>

01:39:09.063 --> 01:39:11.153
<b>With you on the witness stand,</b>

01:39:11.229 --> 01:39:13.019
<b>I can link him

01:39:14.229 --> 01:39:15.269
<b>I'd rather...</b>

01:39:16.771 --> 01:39:17.811
<b>just get screwed together.</b>

01:39:30.396 --> 01:39:31.436
<b>Your Honor.</b>

01:39:31.813 --> 01:39:34.063
<b>The prosecution's witness is
a wanted head of a gang</b>

01:39:34.146 --> 01:39:35.806
<b>who is accused
of several serious crimes</b>

01:39:35.896 --> 01:39:38.896
<b>including illegal gambling

01:39:38.979 --> 01:39:41.439
<b>Nothing in the law states that</b>

01:39:44.604 --> 01:39:45.604

<b>Guys like me

<b>That bastard was the one.</b>

<b>Here.</b>

01:40:13.813 --> 01:40:19.103
<b>I had this sketch composited
right after I was stabbed.</b>

01:40:22.438 --> 01:40:24.398

<b>and therefore cannot be

01:40:31.521 --> 01:40:32.601
<b>Your Honor,</b>

01:40:33.104 --> 01:40:36.854
<b>this is the witness'

01:40:37.479 --> 01:40:39.479
<b>stating his condition

01:40:39.896 --> 01:40:41.516
<b>The witness is a gang leader.</b>

01:40:41.688 --> 01:40:44.558
<b>Getting stabbed
is normal for him.</b>

01:40:44.896 --> 01:40:46.806
<b>How can that be evidence</b>

01:40:46.896 --> 01:40:48.226
<b>when he could've been
stabbed by someone else?</b>

01:40:48.688 --> 01:40:50.898
<b>He's violating
the defendant's rights</b>

01:40:50.979 --> 01:40:52.599
<b>and is mocking this court!</b>

01:40:52.688 --> 01:40:54.518
<b>Damn, that fucker talks a lot.</b>

01:40:55.521 --> 01:40:56.811
<b>- Hey, Mr. Attorney.
- Witness!</b>

01:40:57.521 --> 01:40:59.521
<b>Would you be able to say that</b>

01:40:59.604 --> 01:41:01.024
<b>if your family
was killed by him?</b>

01:41:01.604 --> 01:41:04.944
<b>The defendant's right?
Nutjobs don't deserve that.</b>

01:41:05.354 --> 01:41:08.404
<b>That fucker
killed people for fun.</b>

01:41:09.104 --> 01:41:12.354
<b>I'm not decent myself,

01:41:13.229 --> 01:41:14.229
<b>Evidence?</b>

01:41:15.313 --> 01:41:16.603
<b>I'll show you the evidence.</b>

01:41:27.479 --> 01:41:32.019
<b>That night, he forced me out
of my car by crashing into it.</b>

01:41:32.229 --> 01:41:35.149
<b>Then he stabbed me twice
in my side.</b>

01:41:35.979 --> 01:41:38.729
<b>During the struggle,
he stabbed me in the chest.</b>

01:41:38.813 --> 01:41:42.943
<b>I also cut my fingers trying
to grab his knife. See?</b>

01:41:44.979 --> 01:41:47.439
<b>If I were the average man,
I'd be dead too.</b>

01:41:49.188 --> 01:41:51.268
<b>You should have him
take his clothes off too.</b>

01:41:51.646 --> 01:41:54.936
<b>I stabbed his left chest,
so there will be a wound.</b>

01:42:02.521 --> 01:42:05.651
<b>Also check his hands.
You'll find a lot of scars.</b>

01:42:05.896 --> 01:42:07.096
<b>Stabbing is a tricky job,</b>

01:42:07.188 --> 01:42:09.148
<b>so you cut yourself
here and there.</b>

01:42:09.396 --> 01:42:10.936
<b>Your nails get broken too.</b>

01:42:12.813 --> 01:42:14.063
<b>And lastly,</b>

01:42:18.063 --> 01:42:19.733
<b>that fucker wrote this.</b>

01:42:22.229 --> 01:42:24.269
<b>Analyze his handwriting,
and you'll get a match.</b>

01:42:25.604 --> 01:42:27.854
<b>For reference,
Hur Sang-do was my friend.</b>

01:42:27.938 --> 01:42:30.438
<b>HUR WAS KILLED WITH MY KNIFE</b>

01:42:31.604 --> 01:42:34.354
<b>Hur and his lieutenant

01:42:34.688 --> 01:42:36.398
<b>I feel bad for O-seong,</b>

01:42:37.146 --> 01:42:38.896
<b>but if Kang spills everything,</b>

01:42:39.229 --> 01:42:41.099
<b>we can blame O-seong for it.</b>

01:42:43.188 --> 01:42:45.308
<b>HUR WAS KILLED WITH MY KNIFE

01:42:47.563 --> 01:42:50.023
<b>HUR WAS KILLED WITH MY KNIFE</b>

<b>Considering the defendant's

<b>wanton disregard for human life,</b>

<b>and the pain
