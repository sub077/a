00:01:54.691 --> 00:01:55.958
Alexis?

2
00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.729
Are you okay?

3
00:01:59.762 --> 00:02:02.965
Are the kids okay?

4
00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:05.367
Yeah.

5
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.470
They're fine.

6
00:02:08.503 --> 00:02:09.739
They're fine.

7
00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:19.582
That was so real.

8
00:02:19.615 --> 00:02:23.318
They ran away.

9
00:02:23.351 --> 00:02:26.488
And I could hear the kids
yelling, like, far away

10
00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:30.258
and I could see
their footprints on the sand.

11
00:02:30.292 --> 00:02:31.728
I followed them.

12
00:02:31.761 --> 00:02:32.995
But I couldn't go in the water.

13
00:02:33.029 --> 00:02:34.997
It was like it was glass.

14
00:02:35.031 --> 00:02:36.498
And I'm hitting the water,

15
00:02:36.531 --> 00:02:38.901
but it's like a window
at an aquarium.

16
00:02:38.935 --> 00:02:42.537
And I could see the kids
looking at me and I'm just...

17
00:02:42.571 --> 00:02:44.339
It's just a dream.

18
00:02:44.372 --> 00:02:45.842
It's not real.

19
00:02:45.875 --> 00:02:49.277
No, David.

20
00:02:49.311 --> 00:02:50.813
It was so real.

21
00:02:54.784 --> 00:02:56.418
I have to clean the kitchen.

22
00:02:56.451 --> 00:02:58.320
What? Now?

23
00:02:58.353 --> 00:02:59.655
Yes.

24
00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:01.824
Favvy's coming. She judges.

25
00:03:01.858 --> 00:03:04.493
Dude, fuck Favvy.

26
00:03:04.526 --> 00:03:07.395
- Don't curse my sister.
- Sorry.

27
00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:11.333
Daddy, my tooth is wiggly!
Is it ready to come out?

28
00:03:11.366 --> 00:03:12.802
Yeah, here, let me see it.

29
00:03:12.835 --> 00:03:14.670
- Let me see, let me see.
- You're going to pull it out.

30
00:03:14.704 --> 00:03:17.673
No I won't.
I just want to see it, okay?

31
00:03:17.707 --> 00:03:18.975
Open your mouth.

32
00:03:19.008 --> 00:03:20.475
Go "ah."

33
00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:23.045
Open.

34
00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:24.747
- This one, right?
- Mm-hmm.

35
00:03:24.781 --> 00:03:27.049
Oh, wow.

36
00:03:27.083 --> 00:03:29.417
It is loose.

37
00:03:29.451 --> 00:03:31.520
- Does it hurt you?
- Mm-hmm.

38
00:03:31.553 --> 00:03:32.889
Okay, honey.

39
00:03:32.922 --> 00:03:34.056
Daddy!

40
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.758
Hey, look, if you swallow it

41
00:03:35.792 --> 00:03:37.960
you can't get all the money
from the Tooth Fairy.

42
00:03:37.994 --> 00:03:39.427
Can I have $10?

43
00:03:39.461 --> 00:03:40.997
What? For a tooth?

44
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.634
Christ, I thank you for this
bounty and your blessings.

45
00:03:44.667 --> 00:03:47.569
I will serve as an instrument
of your will this day.

46
00:03:47.603 --> 00:03:48.805
Please send
your guardian angels

47
00:03:48.838 --> 00:03:51.040
to watch over
my wife and children,

48
00:03:51.073 --> 00:03:54.543
her mom, Janet, and sister,
Faviola, and Jazmin.

49
00:03:54.577 --> 00:03:59.682
Almighty God who lives and rules
the world without end, amen.

50
00:03:59.715 --> 00:04:01.416
- Amen.
- Amen.

51
00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:04.419
Okay, the big date...
what happened?

52
00:04:04.452 --> 00:04:07.123
So, he takes me to this
really nice steak place.

53
00:04:07.156 --> 00:04:08.591
Is the dude on Tinder?

54
00:04:08.624 --> 00:04:10.559
Did he super like you?

55
00:04:10.593 --> 00:04:12.494
I am on Tinder, David,

56
00:04:12.527 --> 00:04:14.764
because not everyone
won the marriage lottery.

57
00:04:16.065 --> 00:04:17.633
I can't believe
you're on Tinder.

58
00:04:17.667 --> 00:04:19.869
- Alexis.
- David, stop.

59
00:04:21.871 --> 00:04:26.075
Hey, what's up, sis?

60
00:04:26.108 --> 00:04:27.844
All this food
for Jazmin's quince?

61
00:04:29.946 --> 00:04:32.514
What? I'm hungry,
and it smells good.

62
00:04:32.547 --> 00:04:34.851
Mija, you are so pretty.

63
00:04:34.884 --> 00:04:36.118
Hey, can I do her makeup?

64
00:04:36.152 --> 00:04:38.855
- No.
- We have someone.

65
00:04:38.888 --> 00:04:40.122
You want to help us?

66
00:04:40.156 --> 00:04:41.556
We have to start
shredding the pork.

67
00:04:41.591 --> 00:04:43.391
Mommy, my eyes burn.

68
00:04:43.425 --> 00:04:44.694
Baby, fix the alarm.

69
00:04:44.727 --> 00:04:45.995
Fix it?
It's doing what it does.

70
00:04:46.028 --> 00:04:47.529
It's all smoky in here.
Open up a window.

71
00:04:47.562 --> 00:04:50.532
- Oh, mami.
- Take the battery out.

72
00:04:50.565 --> 00:04:54.469
Chill with the chilis
for one second.

73
00:04:56.205 --> 00:04:57.773
- I got to go, okay?
- Take Dylan to his game.

74
00:04:57.807 --> 00:04:59.075
I can't. I'm late.

75
00:04:59.108 --> 00:05:01.077
Listen, I'll take him.
I'll take Dylan, okay?

76
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.712
I have to go
to the store anyway.

77
00:05:02.745 --> 00:05:04.046
Thank you, Favvy.

78
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.214
Hey, we have to
get your dress.

79
00:05:05.248 --> 00:05:07.482
Hey, when do you
get the dress? What color is it?

80
00:05:07.515 --> 00:05:08.784
Favvy, I'm going to pay
for the dress.

81
00:05:08.818 --> 00:05:10.418
No, no, no, no.
No, seriously.

82
00:05:10.452 --> 00:05:11.821
It's done.
I'm going to cover the dress.

83
00:05:11.854 --> 00:05:14.123
Jazmin, can you help me
cut the tomatoes, please?

84
00:05:14.156 --> 00:05:15.992
- Take of your brother, okay?
- Okay.

85
00:05:16.025 --> 00:05:17.559
- Bye, Dad.

00:11:32.434 --> 00:11:34.236
dipped in acid.

182
00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.442
Arms and legs chain-sawed off,

183
00:11:40.476 --> 00:11:43.512
rolling around
like a seal pup crying for mama.

184
00:11:47.416 --> 00:11:49.551
If your stack's short,

185
00:11:49.586 --> 00:11:51.920
go rob a bank,

186
00:11:51.954 --> 00:11:54.189
rob your own mother,

187
00:11:54.223 --> 00:11:56.859
sell your sister's pussy.

188
00:11:56.892 --> 00:11:58.827
There's no excuses.

189
00:12:20.282 --> 00:12:22.251
Sorry about your shoe.

190
00:12:22.284 --> 00:12:24.219
When you're with us,

191
00:12:24.253 --> 00:12:28.857
nobody, and I mean nobody,

192
00:12:28.891 --> 00:12:30.326
will fuck with you.

193
00:12:33.162 --> 00:12:34.863
Keep your head down.

194
00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:54.483
How many times
have you given that speech?

195
00:12:54.516 --> 00:12:56.485
Too many.

196
00:12:56.518 --> 00:12:58.387
Watch his dumb ass
get killed too,

197
00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:01.457
and I'll say the same shit
to the next guy.

198
00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:03.292
You eat?
Check out the cooler.

199
00:13:03.325 --> 00:13:06.195
I've got cashews,
chicken thighs, cheese,

200
00:13:06.228 --> 00:13:08.530
broccoli and mackerel...
fucking everything.

201
00:13:08.564 --> 00:13:11.433
What the fuck is this shit?
I don't want this shit.

202
00:13:11.467 --> 00:13:12.534
Got all my ketogenic meals.

203
00:13:12.568 --> 00:13:14.069
I dropped like 10 pounds
already.

204
00:13:14.103 --> 00:13:15.371
Why not just
get a fucking burrito?

205
00:13:15.404 --> 00:13:16.905
Because I'm on a mission, dawg.

206
00:13:16.939 --> 00:13:18.273
- Just know this, fool.
- What's up?

207
00:13:18.307 --> 00:13:20.376
- Okay? The human body...
- Yeah.

208
00:13:20.409 --> 00:13:22.645
...is a machine.
Science.

209
00:13:22.679 --> 00:13:24.413
Machine needs fuel.

210
00:13:24.446 --> 00:13:27.216
Show me the pictures of
the bitch you smashed up with.

211
00:13:29.719 --> 00:13:31.487
I saw that celly
from Diamond Bar.

212
00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:32.689
Lucy.

213
00:13:32.722 --> 00:13:34.657
She has a twin sister.

214
00:13:34.691 --> 00:13:36.425
Hilda from El Monte.

215
00:13:36.458 --> 00:13:39.662
- Oof.
- Keep going. Veronica.

216
00:13:39.696 --> 00:13:41.230
Why is she dressed like
a fucking security guard?

217
00:13:41.263 --> 00:13:43.165
Because she's
a security guard, fool.

218
00:13:43.198 --> 00:13:44.500
With big-ass titties.

219
00:13:44.533 --> 00:13:46.168
Look how the fucking vest
wraps around them.

220
00:13:46.201 --> 00:13:47.369
- Yeah, yeah. Alright.
- Know what I'm saying?

221
00:13:47.403 --> 00:13:48.671
Here she is with
a carrot in her ass.

222
00:13:48.705 --> 00:13:50.939
No. No.

223
00:13:50.973 --> 00:13:52.307
- Come on, fool.
- I'm good, eh?

224
00:13:52.341 --> 00:13:54.543
- Oh, shit.
- You need Jesus, homey.

225
00:13:54.577 --> 00:13:56.378
I need more carrots, dawg.

226
00:14:06.221 --> 00:14:08.157
- Tía.
- Buenos días.

227
00:14:13.295 --> 00:14:15.431
Hey, Tío.

228
00:14:15.464 --> 00:14:17.199
What's up, prima?
How you doing?

229
00:14:17.232 --> 00:14:19.234
- Good. How are you?
- Good to see you, man.

230
00:14:19.268 --> 00:14:21.003
- I was just in Rosarito.
- Oh, yeah?

231
00:14:21.036 --> 00:14:23.005
- Yeah. We missed you.
- Oh, well.

232
00:14:23.038 --> 00:14:25.608
Hey, you know key holder
from Big Loma's

233
00:14:25.642 --> 00:14:27.409
came through this morning?

234
00:14:27.443 --> 00:14:29.612
Victor.
The dude was nervous as fuck.

235
00:14:29.646 --> 00:14:32.214
Marisol, Victor from Big Loma's?

236
00:14:34.349 --> 00:14:36.018
He's good. They called.

237
00:14:36.051 --> 00:14:37.219
He checks out.

238
00:14:37.252 --> 00:14:39.388
Of course he's nervous as fuck.
I mean, look at you guys.

239
00:14:39.421 --> 00:14:41.390
You guys look like
a couple of fucking monsters.

240
00:14:41.423 --> 00:14:42.692
That little dude is used to

241
00:14:42.725 --> 00:14:44.259
dealing with
little fucking homeys,

242
00:14:44.293 --> 00:14:46.128
and now he's talking
to the fucking power.

243
00:14:46.161 --> 00:14:47.329
Just being cautious, Tío.

244
00:14:47.362 --> 00:14:48.530
Oh, yeah?
I'll be cautious, okay?

245
00:14:48.564 --> 00:14:50.065
You just do your fucking job.

246
00:14:50.098 --> 00:14:51.601
Come on, Tío.

247
00:14:51.634 --> 00:14:53.603
The cops blasted the other dude
I was fucking with.

248
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Quiet, they're listening.

249
00:14:55.042 --> 00:14:56.333
How's the count?

250
00:14:57.458 --> 00:14:58.667
Keep it tight.

251
00:15:00.125 --> 00:15:00.833
Pay attention.

252
00:15:00.875 --> 00:15:02.792
Big Lomas has to keep up...

253
00:15:02.833 --> 00:15:04.667
...or they'll green light 'em.

254
00:15:04.708 --> 00:15:06.917
Don't forget
you work for Wizard.

255
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
It's under control.

256
00:15:11.167 --> 00:15:12.958
I heard a prison rumor.

257
00:15:13.667 --> 00:15:16.000
What prison rumor?

258
00:15:16.042 --> 00:15:17.625
Another three dead.

259
00:15:17.667 --> 00:15:21.917
Wizard hit the Cartel.

260
00:15:21.631 --> 00:15:24.566
Hey, for Jazmin's quince,
take this, eh?

261
00:15:24.601 --> 00:15:27.369
Put that down for the food.
Alexis's mom's all over it.

262
00:15:27.402 --> 00:15:30.272
- They've been cooking all day.
- Well, take it for the beer.

263
00:15:30.305 --> 00:15:31.273
Alright, the beer.

264
00:15:31.306 --> 00:15:32.775
Come here. Give me a hug.

265
00:15:35.277 --> 00:15:36.746
Thank you.
I love you, alright?

266
00:15:36.779 --> 00:15:39.716
- Be careful.
- I love you, Tío.

267
00:15:42.417 --> 00:15:44.453
- See you at the party.
- See you at the party.

268
00:15:51.861 --> 00:15:54.530
Hey, how come I didn't get
an invite to the quince?

269
00:15:54.563 --> 00:15:56.265
You can come through.

270
00:15:56.298 --> 00:15:57.767
That's not an invitation.

271
00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.836
That's you saying come through
'cause I asked you.

272
00:15:59.869 --> 00:16:02.437
A real invitation is like a nice
card with lace edges and shit.

273
00:16:02.471 --> 00:16:04.172
Well, don't fucking
come through then.

274
00:16:04.206 --> 00:16:06.375
I want to come through.
I'd like to support your family.

275
00:16:06.408 --> 00:16:09.177
I know Alexis gets uncomfortable
around me so I stay away.

276
00:16:09.211 --> 00:16:11.848
If you got beef with Alexis,
go have coffee with her.

277
00:16:11.881 --> 00:16:13.448
You got her number, homey.

278
00:16:13.482 --> 00:16:15.417
Coffee, yeah, yeah.
I'll call her up.

279
00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:16.853
You really wanted
a printed invitation?

280
00:16:16.886 --> 00:16:18.420
Yes.

281
00:16:18.453 --> 00:16:20.255
They're like 20 bucks each.

282
00:16:20.723 --> 00:16:22.391
I thought it would
be a nice souvenir.

283
00:16:22.424 --> 00:16:23.292
Jazmin's a nice girl.

284
00:16:23.325 --> 00:16:26.629
Yo, how is it you
don't have no kids, huh?

285
00:16:26.663 --> 00:16:29.231
Condoms, IUDs,
birth control pills,

286
00:16:29.264 --> 00:16:31.433
morning after pills,
plan A, plan B, plan C.

287
00:16:31.466 --> 00:16:33.168
- There's a lot of options, boy.
- You're going to hell, man.

288
00:16:33.201 --> 00:16:34.604
Yeah,
but I'm at peace with that.

289
00:16:34.637 --> 00:16:36.405
I'm not going to argue
about Jesus with you.

290
00:16:39.141 --> 00:16:40.743
You ever meditate?

291
00:16:40.777 --> 00:16:42.612
No.

292
00:16:42.645 --> 00:16:43.880
No?

293
00:16:43.913 --> 00:16:45.648
No,
I don't fuck with that.

294
00:16:45.682 --> 00:16:47.617
That shit's satanic.

295
00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:50.720
Okay, so some people
say yoga's satanic.

296
00:16:50.753 --> 00:16:54.289
Some people. They do.

297
00:16:54.323 --> 00:16:55.457
I'm doing that mindfulness shit.

298
00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:57.326
The fuck is that?

299
00:16:57.359 --> 00:16:58.661
So first thing in the morning...

300
00:16:58.695 --> 00:17:00.630
- Yeah?
- Clear my head of noise.

301
00:17:00.663 --> 00:17:04.533
Boom.
Focus on my breathing.

302
00:17:04.566 --> 00:17:06.535
Observe my thoughts.

303
00:17:06.568 --> 00:17:09.571
Then I lean into my day.

304
00:17:09.606 --> 00:17:11.306
Are we killing anybody today?

305
00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:13.108
I've got fucking nice shoes on.

306
00:17:19.616 --> 00:17:22.184
Guppi.

307
00:17:36.899 --> 00:17:40.502
That's good work.
That's clean lines.

308
00:17:42.237 --> 00:17:43.472
You mind if I do that?

309
00:17:43.505 --> 00:17:45.207
It's always been
a dream of mine, huh?

310
00:17:51.748 --> 00:17:53.515
One thing.

311
00:17:53.548 --> 00:17:55.685
You got what we came for?

312
00:17:55.718 --> 00:17:57.386
- Hmm?
- Bag.

313
00:18:01.791 --> 00:18:04.359
Looks good.

314
00:18:04.393 --> 00:18:06.461
Creeper, stop.

315
00:18:06.495 --> 00:18:08.563
Mm.

316
00:18:08.598 --> 00:18:10.399
How was the funeral?

317
00:18:10.432 --> 00:18:12.602
You know, kind of sad.

318
00:18:12.635 --> 00:18:15.638
There's family, so laying kids
and shit out there.

319
00:18:15.672 --> 00:18:19.742
Sorry about your boy, homey.

320
00:18:19.776 --> 00:18:21.778
I am.

321
00:18:21.811 --> 00:18:25.581
Dude had a family
but he also knew the reglas.

322
00:18:25.615 --> 00:18:29.852
He made his decision.
We made ours.

323
00:18:29.886 --> 00:18:33.589
I'mma take that green light
off of you, okay?

324
00:18:33.623 --> 00:18:37.259
You show your face,
you walk the block,

325
00:18:37.292 --> 00:18:40.797
you conduct
your business in safety.

326
00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:42.531
Thank you.

327
00:18:48.004 --> 00:18:49.839
Motherfucker
got himself killed

328
00:18:49.872 --> 00:18:51.774
and had four fucking kids.

329
00:18:51.808 --> 00:18:54.577
Why would you fuck with that?

330
00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:57.412
You got the money,
pay the fucking money.

331
00:18:57.446 --> 00:18:58.981
It's greed. These guys
are fucking criminals.

332
00:18:59.015 --> 00:19:00.750
It's in their nature
to cheat the system.

333
00:19:00.783 --> 00:19:03.251
It's nothing new.

334
00:19:03.285 --> 00:19:04.654
It could happen to us.

335
00:19:04.687 --> 00:19:07.623
- No.
- A short count,

336
00:19:07.657 --> 00:19:09.458
or we end up on the wrong side
of the politics,

337
00:19:09.491 --> 00:19:11.526
- I mean, we'll get smoked.
- Hey.

338
00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:12.662
You're connected as fuck.

339
00:19:12.695 --> 00:19:15.297
No one is touching you never.

340
00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:18.333
Hey, homey, that shit
smells like ass.

341
00:19:18.366 --> 00:19:20.302
This? This is fish.
It's going to have an odor.

342
00:19:20.335 --> 00:19:21.838
Like summertime dead body nasty.

343
00:19:21.871 --> 00:19:23.005
Well, I'm not going
to apologize for it.

344
00:19:23.039 --> 00:19:24.439
Maybe you're too sensitive.

345
00:19:24.473 --> 00:19:25.540
I've got way more energy
on this diet.

346
00:19:25.574 --> 00:19:27.342
That's not a good thing.

347
00:19:27.375 --> 00:19:28.276
You want this last piece?

348
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:29.544
No, I don't want it.

349
00:19:29.579 --> 00:19:31.881
Throw that shit
out the fucking window.

350
00:19:31.914 --> 00:19:33.315
Hey, what's up big dog?

351
00:19:33.348 --> 00:19:36.518
It's been a minute.
You good?

352
00:19:36.551 --> 00:19:37.820
Okay, let me get into it, homey.

353
00:19:37.854 --> 00:19:41.389
Don't trip. I got you.

354
00:19:41.423 --> 00:19:42.658
Side mission, dawg.

355
00:19:52.602 --> 00:19:54.402
What's up, holmes?

356
00:19:58.708 --> 00:19:59.809
Wake up.

357
00:20:18.995 --> 00:20:21.631
He fucked the homey's lady.

358
00:20:21.664 --> 00:20:24.399
The vato dropped all his cash
on an engagement ring

359
00:20:24.432 --> 00:20:26.636
and then finds this puto's
number on her fucking phone

360
00:20:26.669 --> 00:20:28.370
sexting the fuck out of her.

361
00:20:28.403 --> 00:20:30.372
Come on.

362
00:20:30.405 --> 00:20:33.542
So let's squash this
before shit pops off.

363
00:20:33.576 --> 00:20:34.610
What do you want me to do?

364
00:20:34.644 --> 00:20:37.880
Cut him loose and clean him up.

365
00:20:37.914 --> 00:20:39.882
You guys can't do this shit.

366
00:20:39.916 --> 00:20:42.350
These ain't Vietnam, homey.

367
00:20:42.384 --> 00:20:44.787
We got business with the Bloods.

368
00:20:44.821 --> 00:20:46.889
The homeboy needs
to check his lady,

369
00:20:46.923 --> 00:20:50.927
not the motherfuckers
piping her, okay?

370
00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:53.361
Alright, David.

371
00:20:53.395 --> 00:20:54.630
My bad.

372
00:20:56.632 --> 00:20:59.035
Get the motherfucker in here.

373
00:20:59.068 --> 00:21:01.536
Hey, Pete.

374
00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:03.438
Four-five this motherfucker.

375
00:21:08.978 --> 00:21:10.345
Motherfucker.

376
00:21:20.923 --> 00:21:22.592
Look, they got the homey.

377
00:21:22.625 --> 00:21:24.794
What the fuck, hey?

378
00:21:31.033 --> 00:21:33.002
Hold up, hold up.
What's up with it?

379
00:21:33.035 --> 00:21:35.705
Hold the fuck up, Blood.

380
00:21:35.738 --> 00:21:37.039
What the fuck, man?

381
00:21:37.073 --> 00:21:38.608
No disrespect.

382
00:21:38.641 --> 00:21:40.810
It wasn't business,
and it wasn't racial.

383
00:21:40.843 --> 00:21:43.045
Just some young guns
tripping personal.

384
00:21:43.079 --> 00:21:45.047
Checked those responsible.

385
00:21:45.081 --> 00:21:46.949
Got your boy before
it got crazy, man.

386
00:21:50.219 --> 00:21:52.889
I'mma keep it G with you, David.

387
00:21:52.922 --> 00:21:54.991
And I know you've got
your chess pieces

388
00:21:55.024 --> 00:21:56.759
and for sure I've got mine.

389
00:21:56.792 --> 00:21:59.595
But I want all this
shit to die today.

390
00:21:59.629 --> 00:22:04.000
I want to walk away clean
and focus on the business,

391
00:22:04.033 --> 00:22:06.903
you know what I'm saying?

392
00:22:06.936 --> 00:22:10.840
You're a candle in the darkness.

393
00:22:10.873 --> 00:22:12.909
Keep that shit real with you.

394
00:22:36.531 --> 00:22:38.500
You didn't have to do that.

395
00:22:38.533 --> 00:22:40.903
Yeah, I did.

396
00:22:40.937 --> 00:22:45.007
Bone helped me solve some
problems back in the day, so...

397
00:22:45.041 --> 00:22:47.542
60, right?

398
00:22:50.112 --> 00:22:52.848
There you go.
It's all there.

399
00:22:52.882 --> 00:22:54.116
Show it to me.

400
00:22:56.886 --> 00:22:58.587
Okay.

401
00:23:02.091 --> 00:23:06.162
It's been kind of slow
right now, you know?

402
00:23:06.195 --> 00:23:08.931
A lot of college kids
out of town.

403
00:23:08.965 --> 00:23:11.067
Got that hook up though on that
good molly if you need it.

404
00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:12.868
Got two homeys out of
San Francisco.

405
00:23:12.902 --> 00:23:14.770
They slinging their shit left
and right to all them

406
00:23:14.804 --> 00:23:16.605
Silicon Valley motherfuckers.

407
00:23:16.639 --> 00:23:18.774
Everybody wants,
like, acid and LSD.

408
00:23:18.808 --> 00:23:20.977
It's crazy up there.

409
00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:22.278
They microdose now.

410
00:23:22.311 --> 00:23:24.046
They take these small doses
every day.

411
00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:26.816
It's supposed to make them
more creative or some shit.

412
00:23:26.849 --> 00:23:30.186
Took acid every day for a month
straight but big fucking doses.

413
00:23:30.219 --> 00:23:33.055
Big. Made me feel like
I was metal wire

414
00:23:33.089 --> 00:23:35.691
and fucking alien shit
flying all over the place.

415
00:23:35.725 --> 00:23:37.860
- Damn, homey.
- Fucking weird, fool.

416
00:23:37.893 --> 00:23:41.197
Hey, I don't want
to break it up or nothing

417
00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:43.766
but if you guys know
of a good chemist, let me know.

418
00:23:43.799 --> 00:23:45.768
Adderall too,
you know what I mean?

419
00:23:45.801 --> 00:23:47.870
Yeah, it's like popcorn
to these college kids.

420
00:23:47.903 --> 00:23:49.872
Trust me when I tell you.

421
00:23:49.905 --> 00:23:51.140
I'll ask around.

422
00:23:53.642 --> 00:23:56.846
The Paisas, man, they're giving
us great competition, you know?

423
00:23:56.879 --> 00:23:58.114
They don't pay no taxes

424
00:23:58.147 --> 00:24:00.182
so their...
their prices are better.

425
00:24:00.216 --> 00:24:02.151
You can't make no money
'cause a border brother's

426
00:24:02.184 --> 00:24:04.153
got better prices?

427
00:24:06.188 --> 00:24:07.990
Whoa, hey, whoa, whoa.

428
00:24:08.024 --> 00:24:10.558
I understand.

429
00:24:12.695 --> 00:24:15.831
Yellow is one of
my favorite colors.

430
00:24:15.865 --> 00:24:18.834
45 minutes.
Where on earth is David?

431
00:24:20.336 --> 00:24:21.771
Hey, you good?

432
00:24:21.804 --> 00:24:23.806
The dress
isn't happening today.

433
00:24:23.839 --> 00:24:26.809
The Mexican Kardashians
got here before us.

434
00:24:26.842 --> 00:24:29.345
- And they're closed tomorrow.
- Are we going to get my dress?

435
00:24:29.378 --> 00:24:31.814
Yes, we are going to get
your dress, mami, don't worry.

436
00:24:31.847 --> 00:24:33.315
Babe,
I really need your help.

437
00:24:33.349 --> 00:24:34.750
Okay.

438
00:24:34.784 --> 00:24:36.185
We can't let this
ruin her quince.

439
00:24:36.218 --> 00:24:38.754
Let me get into it.
Alright, give me 15 minutes.

440
00:24:38.788 --> 00:24:40.956
Thank you, baby.

441
00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:42.925
Fuck.

442
00:24:50.399 --> 00:24:51.967
- Vamonos.
- We got here first.

443
00:24:52.001 --> 00:24:53.669
It's my wedding dress.

444
00:24:53.702 --> 00:24:55.004
- Bye.
- Vamonos.

445
00:24:55.037 --> 00:24:58.641
I've been waiting
the whole week for this.

446
00:24:58.674 --> 00:25:00.342
Bye.

447
00:25:00.376 --> 00:25:02.344
- Okay, let's get this done.
- Where is the dress?

448
00:25:02.378 --> 00:25:05.014
- Definitely not that one.
- Let's see.

449
00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:11.287
You've got a connect out of
San Diego Chicano Park

450
00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:16.625
who's given you 30 pounds
of meth a week since April.

451
00:25:16.659 --> 00:25:21.030
So you owe back taxes
on 120 pounds.

452
00:25:23.732 --> 00:25:25.267
You got 50 grand?

453
00:25:29.205 --> 00:25:32.374
Alright, let's call it a day.

454
00:25:32.408 --> 00:25:34.743
I've got to get back
to the ranch, homey.

455
00:25:40.149 --> 00:25:41.350
Daddy!

456
00:25:41.383 --> 00:25:45.154
Tía Favvy took us to In-N-Out.

457
00:25:45.187 --> 00:25:46.889
Where's Alexis?

458
00:25:46.922 --> 00:25:48.757
In the room napping.

459
00:25:48.791 --> 00:25:52.027
How'd the dress work out?

460
00:25:52.061 --> 00:25:54.196
Thank you.

461
00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:57.366
No, for real. It's so cute.

462
00:25:57.399 --> 00:25:59.368
Jazmin is so happy.

463
00:26:17.987 --> 00:26:20.689
- Babe?
- Hmm?

464
00:26:20.723 --> 00:26:23.292
What's up?

465
00:26:23.325 --> 00:26:26.729
The count's 20 grand short.

466
00:26:26.762 --> 00:26:28.731
Are you sure?

467
00:26:35.371 --> 00:26:37.139
Shit, I mean, I don't count it.

468
00:26:37.173 --> 00:26:39.909
It's Big Loma's gang.

469
00:26:39.942 --> 00:26:42.111
Motherfucker.

470
00:26:42.144 --> 00:26:44.113
It's a new guy, and he didn't
know how much they owed

471
00:26:44.146 --> 00:26:45.848
and I forgot to check the kite
from the little girl

472
00:26:45.881 --> 00:26:47.349
and I was running late
to hit all the neighborhoods.

473
00:26:47.383 --> 00:26:48.184
It's okay, it's okay.

474
00:26:48.217 --> 00:26:50.920
Calm down, baby.

475
00:26:50.953 --> 00:26:52.855
Look, I have a little float
that I keep week to week

476
00:26:52.888 --> 00:26:54.323
for this kind of thing.

477
00:26:54.356 --> 00:26:57.993
But we can't afford to cover
other people's mistakes.

478
00:27:02.031 --> 00:27:03.732
Is that Wizard?

479
00:27:06.535 --> 00:27:08.337
- Yes?
- Listen up.

480
00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:11.907
Collection needs to go
smooth this month.

481
00:27:11.941 --> 00:27:14.109
I've got something
big happening.

482
00:27:14.143 --> 00:27:15.778
No fuck ups.

483
00:27:15.811 --> 00:27:17.146
I understand.

484
00:27:17.179 --> 00:27:19.982
Put the fool on.
I know he's in there.

485
00:27:20.015 --> 00:27:23.452
Yeah, just a second.

486
00:27:23.485 --> 00:27:26.155
He wants to talk to you.

487
00:27:37.533 --> 00:27:39.501
Yes, sir.

488
00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:46.542
Hello.

489
00:27:58.354 --> 00:27:59.855
Just heard him laughing
and then he hung up.

490
00:27:59.888 --> 00:28:01.257
What did he say?

491
00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:03.292
He said that there's a lot
going on this week

492
00:28:03.325 --> 00:28:07.329
and he needs this week's
taxes to go smoothly.

493
00:28:07.363 --> 00:28:08.897
No mistakes.

494
00:28:08.931 --> 00:28:10.466
Is he fucking listening to us?

495
00:28:10.499 --> 00:28:12.434
Is this fucking place bugged?

496
00:28:12.468 --> 00:28:14.503
Calm down, calm down.
Calm down, baby.

497
00:28:14.536 --> 00:28:16.138
Calm down, okay?

498
00:28:16.171 --> 00:28:17.840
Go relax.

499
00:28:17.873 --> 00:28:20.509
Go have a beer.
Go play with the kids.

500
00:28:20.542 --> 00:28:22.945
Then you're going
to go back out, okay?

501
00:28:22.978 --> 00:28:25.848
Finish your paper route
so I can package all of this up

502
00:28:25.881 --> 00:28:28.550
and get it out of our house,
okay?

503
00:28:28.585 --> 00:28:30.486
Okay.

504
00:28:43.966 --> 00:28:46.035
Okay.

505
00:28:55.878 --> 00:28:58.847
You owe me
20 fucking grand, homey.

506
00:28:58.881 --> 00:29:01.383
I gave you basic
fucking instructions.

507
00:29:01.417 --> 00:29:04.053
He'll splatter your brains
all over your old lady.

508
00:29:04.086 --> 00:29:06.388
You don't want that.
I don't want that.

509
00:29:06.422 --> 00:29:08.324
And she sure as shit
don't want that.

510
00:29:08.357 --> 00:29:10.359
I do. I want that.

511
00:29:10.392 --> 00:29:12.595
Hey, this guy, he wants that.

512
00:29:12.629 --> 00:29:14.330
I want that, Victor.

513
00:29:16.532 --> 00:29:19.401
I'm asking you, homey,
why would you do that?

514
00:29:21.937 --> 00:29:23.439
- Open your mouth.
- Okay!

515
00:29:23.472 --> 00:29:25.274
I'll take your bitch
as collateral

516
00:29:25.307 --> 00:29:27.443
and put her in my fucking truck
until you make it right, homey.

517
00:29:27.476 --> 00:29:28.344
- I'll make it right.
- Huh?

518
00:29:28.377 --> 00:29:29.878
- I'll make it right.
- I can't hear you.

519
00:29:29.912 --> 00:29:31.046
What the fuck are you saying,
homey?

520
00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:32.514
I'll make it right.

521
00:29:32.548 --> 00:29:35.250
- What?
- I'll make it right.

522
00:29:35.284 --> 00:29:37.019
In the freezer,
there's a TV dinner.

523
00:29:37.052 --> 00:29:39.589
What kind of fucking TV dinner?
I'm on a special diet.

524
00:29:44.426 --> 00:29:46.995
The money's in the freezer.

525
00:29:47.029 --> 00:29:48.530
You were hiding
the money, Victor.

526
00:29:48.564 --> 00:29:50.999
- I'm sorry.
- Why?

527
00:29:51.033 --> 00:29:55.237
Why did you think
to fucking do that, Victor?

528
00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:57.406
My little girl's got leukemia

529
00:29:57.439 --> 00:29:59.041
and we ain't got no insurance.

530
00:29:59.074 --> 00:30:01.678
Victor, you think
I'm stupid, homey?

531
00:30:01.711 --> 00:30:04.546
This motherfucker. Try again.

532
00:30:04.581 --> 00:30:06.248
Why did you hide
the fucking money, Victor?

533
00:30:06.281 --> 00:30:08.984
My little girl's got
leukemia, man. I'm sorry.

534
00:30:09.017 --> 00:30:11.954
Prove it.

535
00:30:11.987 --> 00:30:14.256
This morning in
the children's hospital.

536
00:30:14.289 --> 00:30:15.991
He's lying, David.

537
00:30:18.427 --> 00:30:20.062
What's her name?

538
00:30:20.095 --> 00:30:21.263
Isabella.

539
00:30:21.296 --> 00:30:22.965
- How old is she?
- Five.

540
00:30:22.998 --> 00:30:24.466
- Where was she born?
- Montebello.

541
00:30:26.468 --> 00:30:29.471
What am I doing?
David, what am I doing?

542
00:30:29.505 --> 00:30:32.040
- Hm?
- Hold up.

543
00:30:32.074 --> 00:30:34.476
Fuck.

544
00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:35.944
Don't, David.

545
00:30:45.755 --> 00:30:47.356
Let's go, Creeper.

546
00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:17.352
That's your fucking
problem, right there.

547
00:31:17.386 --> 00:31:18.621
You can't compartmentalize.

548
00:31:18.655 --> 00:31:20.289
You're taxing 43
different street gangs.

549
00:31:20.322 --> 00:31:22.157
That's thousands of dudes
in the most violent,

550
00:31:22.191 --> 00:31:23.593
fucked-up subculture
in Los Angeles,

551
00:31:23.626 --> 00:31:25.427
and you want to play
the fucking pope out here.

552
00:31:25.461 --> 00:31:29.097
You need to know when to shut
the fuck up Creeper.

553
00:31:29.131 --> 00:31:30.667
Alexis is going to
fuck your shit up.

554
00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:33.001
Yeah, I already fucking know,
homey, I already know.

555
00:31:33.035 --> 00:31:34.604
I already know, alright?

556
00:31:34.637 --> 00:31:36.438
Don't got to fucking remind me.

557
00:31:40.108 --> 00:31:42.044
What the fuck?

558
00:31:42.077 --> 00:31:43.412
What?

559
00:31:43.445 --> 00:31:45.682
Hey, we got to go see Venom
from Hillside.

560
00:31:45.715 --> 00:31:47.483
200 fucking grand.

561
00:31:47.516 --> 00:31:49.184
Hillside Trece 200 grand?

562
00:31:49.218 --> 00:31:51.588
- Yeah.
- Wow.

563
00:31:51.621 --> 00:31:53.422
They must have had
a serious fucking come-up

564
00:31:53.455 --> 00:31:54.556
over there, huh?

565
00:31:54.591 --> 00:31:56.091
Let's take their money.

566
00:31:56.124 --> 00:31:58.193
I already fucked
every bitch in their hood.

567
00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:25.153
David?

568
00:32:25.187 --> 00:32:27.456
Yeah.

569
00:32:27.489 --> 00:32:28.658
Alright.

570
00:32:48.678 --> 00:32:50.178
Have a seat.

571
00:32:50.212 --> 00:32:52.582
Drink some pista, holmes.

572
00:32:52.615 --> 00:32:54.717
You know I ain't here
to socialize.

573
00:32:56.653 --> 00:32:59.187
Your uncle used to do your job.

574
00:32:59.221 --> 00:33:01.423
Him and that fat fuck Spanky.

575
00:33:01.456 --> 00:33:03.392
Went to all the different gangs
in the neighborhood

576
00:33:03.425 --> 00:33:05.294
making collects.

577
00:33:05.327 --> 00:33:08.497
You're only here
because of your fucking daddy.

578
00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:10.700
I earned my way to the top.

579
00:33:10.733 --> 00:33:13.502
I'm here to collect
your fucking taxes.

580
00:33:13.535 --> 00:33:16.639
So put your fucking money
on the table,

581
00:33:16.673 --> 00:33:20.577
stop opening your fucking mouth,
and do as you're fucking told.

582
00:33:20.610 --> 00:33:22.745
I got the money.
That ain't the problem.

583
00:33:22.779 --> 00:33:24.781
Put the fucking fetty
on the table right now

584
00:33:24.814 --> 00:33:27.717
or it's your last supper,
I promise you, my boy.

585
00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:29.451
Right now.

586
00:33:39.194 --> 00:33:40.697
This isn't yours.

587
00:33:49.906 --> 00:33:51.373
Who the fuck are you?

588
00:33:51.406 --> 00:33:54.176
I'm the future and you the past.

589
00:33:54.209 --> 00:33:57.780
So Venom, he work for me now.

590
00:33:57.814 --> 00:34:01.450
And all this right here,
it's my money.

591
00:34:03.485 --> 00:34:05.287
Who the fuck are you?

592
00:34:05.583 --> 00:34:08.292
I'm Conejo,
and don't you forget that name.

593
00:34:08.333 --> 00:34:11.833
When you say it,
you say it with respect.

594
00:34:12.792 --> 00:34:16.875
I know who you are.
I know who you're with.

595
00:34:20.268 --> 00:34:21.904
Okay, Conejo.

596
00:34:31.667 --> 00:34:34.667
Sometimes people get confused.

597
00:34:34.708 --> 00:34:37.542
They don't know who is who.

598
00:34:39.333 --> 00:34:41.875
Trust me. This...

599
00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:45.375
...is a mistake.

600
00:34:45.458 --> 00:34:47.458
I don't know
where you came from...

601
00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:49.417
...or who you are connected to.

602
00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:51.917
But, clearly, you are somebody.

603
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.250
You're touching something big
right now.

604
00:34:56.333 --> 00:34:58.125
Bigger than me...

605
00:34:58.167 --> 00:34:59.542
...bigger than you.

606
00:34:59.625 --> 00:35:01.792
It is very smart...

607
00:35:01.833 --> 00:35:03.167
...and very cold.

608
00:35:03.250 --> 00:35:06.250
You're just a man.

609
00:35:06.333 --> 00:35:07.333
You breathe...

610
00:35:07.375 --> 00:35:09.375
...and bleed.

611
00:35:09.833 --> 00:35:12.667
And so do the people you love.

612
00:35:14.125 --> 00:35:16.667
Look, go talk to your uncle.

613
00:35:16.708 --> 00:35:19.250
Tell him Conejo
is back from Jalisco.

614
00:35:19.333 --> 00:35:21.833
He knows who I am.

615
00:35:21.998 --> 00:35:23.766
Because it's not a mistake.

616
00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:25.400
It's a motherfucking earthquake,

617
00:35:25.434 --> 00:35:27.235
and everything
get knocked down.

618
00:35:27.292 --> 00:35:29.000
Go back to your big house.

619
00:35:29.083 --> 00:35:32.667
Enjoy your pretty wife
and your two kids.

620
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.292
Yeah, like that.

621
00:35:36.333 --> 00:35:38.208
With all due respect...

622
00:35:38.833 --> 00:35:40.917
...this is a bad play.

623
00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:57.466
Let's go, Creeper.

624
00:36:02.542 --> 00:36:05.000
Death is after you.

625
00:36:08.443 --> 00:36:11.047
I got a .380 on each ankle,
.38 on my right, .25 on my left,

626
00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:12.782
chopper in the trunk,
Glock in my belt, fuck.

627
00:36:12.815 --> 00:36:15.317
Don't get too fucking
excited, homey.

628
00:36:15.350 --> 00:36:17.587
It's just a lot
of fucking cash, you feel me?

629
00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:19.789
You know my uncle
whacked Venom's dad.

630
00:36:20.455 --> 00:36:21.858
And he wants to cut
your heart out for sure.

631
00:36:21.891 --> 00:36:24.761
You say the word,
I'll push that bitch's wig back.

632
00:36:24.794 --> 00:36:27.697
- I don't want that, Creeper.
- I'm on it.

633
00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:32.001
Who is he?

634
00:36:32.034 --> 00:36:33.636
Who's Conejo?

635
00:36:33.669 --> 00:36:35.938
It's a confident move,
taking Wizard's money.

636
00:36:35.972 --> 00:36:38.573
He's got to be
connected as fuck.

637
00:36:38.608 --> 00:36:39.842
I know who he is.

638
00:36:39.876 --> 00:36:41.744
Some fucking West Side
heavy hitter.

639
00:36:41.778 --> 00:36:43.378
Remember he kidnapped people?

640
00:36:43.411 --> 00:36:45.380
Fucking cut them up,
burned that dude one time,

641
00:36:45.413 --> 00:36:47.349
sent a video tape to his mom.

642
00:36:47.382 --> 00:36:49.886
Fucking straight-up
street terrorist.

643
00:36:49.919 --> 00:36:51.888
But Wizard was going
to have him taken out.

644
00:36:51.921 --> 00:36:53.488
So he bounced down to Mexico.

645
00:36:53.522 --> 00:36:55.958
He's been MIA for like 10 years.

646
00:36:55.992 --> 00:36:58.661
Conejo, fuck that puto, hey?
Fuck him.

647
00:36:58.694 --> 00:37:01.530
I'll skin that motherfucker.
You should have let me have him.

648
00:37:01.563 --> 00:37:04.332
I need to put it to a vote.
I need 24 hours.

649
00:37:04.366 --> 00:37:07.837
It's got to go down
the right way.

650
00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:09.772
You're scared of him.

651
00:37:09.806 --> 00:37:11.874
The fuck did you say?

652
00:37:11.908 --> 00:37:13.709
If you weren't my nephew,
I'd stick your fucking face

653
00:37:13.743 --> 00:37:15.477
in that fire
until you stopped moving.

654
00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:17.013
Alright, holmes?

655
00:37:17.046 --> 00:37:19.381
I ain't scared of any bitch-made
motherfucker, alright?

656
00:37:19.414 --> 00:37:23.485
Hey, and you don't leave till
I fucking tell you to leave.

657
00:37:23.518 --> 00:37:25.087
Sit your fucking ass down.

658
00:37:32.527 --> 00:37:35.064
You're going to mind
somebody, huh?

659
00:37:35.097 --> 00:37:37.633
You're my nephew and I love you
and you're bad, David,

660
00:37:37.667 --> 00:37:40.837
but you ain't fucking
that bad, alright?

661
00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:42.571
Now bounce.

662
00:37:58.154 --> 00:38:00.690
Marisol, give me a plate.

663
00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:26.514
Alexis.

664
00:38:26.548 --> 00:38:27.850
Alexis.

665
00:38:35.591 --> 00:38:39.929
What did you see in me
when we met?

666
00:38:39.962 --> 00:38:41.631
I told you this
a thousand times.

667
00:38:41.664 --> 00:38:44.867
No. There's the story you tell
everyone again and again

668
00:38:44.901 --> 00:38:46.802
because you like telling it.

669
00:38:46.836 --> 00:38:49.071
And people like hearing it.

670
00:38:49.105 --> 00:38:53.576
And then there's the truth.
I want that. The truth.

671
00:38:57.113 --> 00:39:02.118
Okay.
You remember when we met?

672
00:39:02.151 --> 00:39:04.620
The King Taco in South Central?

673
00:39:04.654 --> 00:39:07.790
I'll never forget.

674
00:39:07.823 --> 00:39:09.091
You were acting all stupid

675
00:39:09.125 --> 00:39:11.193
gang banging with your cousins
back then.

676
00:39:11.227 --> 00:39:15.231
Yeah, whatever. We were kids.

677
00:39:15.264 --> 00:39:17.667
That wasn't the first time
I saw you.

678
00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:19.802
What do you mean?

679
00:39:19.835 --> 00:39:21.904
See, a couple of weeks
before you met me

680
00:39:21.938 --> 00:39:24.607
my dad got really,
really drunk.

681
00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:28.510
I hear all this noise,
and I come out of my room,

682
00:39:28.543 --> 00:39:31.847
and my dad is beating
my mom with a chair.

683
00:39:33.042 --> 00:39:41.375
"You whore! You and your kids
should go to hell!"

684
00:39:45.761 --> 00:39:48.698
He beat my mom
until the chair broke.

685
00:39:48.731 --> 00:39:53.903
And my mom is bleeding
and crying and he looks at me,

686
00:39:53.936 --> 00:39:58.240
and he starts walking towards me
and I'm thinking, "I'm dead."

687
00:40:00.977 --> 00:40:04.512
He just walked right past me.
Didn't say anything.

688
00:40:04.546 --> 00:40:09.251
Just walked into his room
and slept for like two days.

689
00:40:12.588 --> 00:40:14.056
So I heard about you,

690
00:40:14.090 --> 00:40:17.059
and you were this big bad
gangster who killed people.

691
00:40:17.093 --> 00:40:18.728
So here I am,

692
00:40:18.761 --> 00:40:20.830
some Mexican-American princess,

693
00:40:20.863 --> 00:40:25.668
I go down to the hood,
figured out where you hung out.

694
00:40:25.701 --> 00:40:29.038
I was going to get you
to fall in love with me

695
00:40:29.071 --> 00:40:31.140
and get you to kill my dad.

696
00:40:34.343 --> 00:40:37.913
Half the plan worked.

697
00:40:37.947 --> 00:40:40.016
Thank God.

698
00:40:40.049 --> 00:40:41.717
He stopped drinking.

699
00:40:49.358 --> 00:40:52.194
David, what's wrong?

700
00:40:52.228 --> 00:40:54.864
People always want
something from me.

701
00:40:57.833 --> 00:41:00.136
You didn't want nothing from me.

702
00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:07.843
That's what I thought.

703
00:41:10.913 --> 00:41:12.581
I love you.

704
00:41:52.354 --> 00:41:53.956
There you are.
Take it from him.

705
00:41:53.989 --> 00:41:55.925
Now reverse it.
Ooba, ooba towards me.

706
00:41:55.958 --> 00:41:58.727
That's established properly.

707
00:41:58.761 --> 00:42:00.062
Armbar, take it, take it.

708
00:42:00.096 --> 00:42:02.698
Merry Christmas.

709
00:42:02.731 --> 00:42:05.668
Outstanding.

710
00:42:05.701 --> 00:42:07.269
- Alright.
- Good job, man.

711
00:42:07.303 --> 00:42:09.004
Okay, go.
Attack, attack, attack.

712
00:42:09.038 --> 00:42:11.874
Tuck your chin.

713
00:42:11.907 --> 00:42:13.742
Give him the ribs,
punch his ribs.

714
00:42:13.776 --> 00:42:15.978
Slow down, technique first.

715
00:42:16.011 --> 00:42:17.746
Take your time. Don't rush it.

716
00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:20.282
Come on, David.
Handle it, handle it.

717
00:42:20.316 --> 00:42:24.653
Good. Good, good, good.
That's it. Good.

718
00:42:24.687 --> 00:42:27.890
Wake up and smell the roses,
not your own blood.

719
00:42:27.923 --> 00:42:30.259
- Make sense?
- Yeah.

720
00:42:37.333 --> 00:42:39.101
You got a drink for us?

721
00:42:39.135 --> 00:42:40.136
Thank you. That's it there.

722
00:42:40.169 --> 00:42:41.303
That's it. That'll work there.

723
00:42:41.337 --> 00:42:42.304
Thank you.

724
00:42:52.214 --> 00:42:54.717
- Gentlemen, how are you?
- Hi, Tío.

725
00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:57.253
Jazmin, happy birthday.

726
00:43:07.897 --> 00:43:09.431
Honey.

727
00:43:11.467 --> 00:43:13.769
David, you know
it's a party, right?

728
00:43:13.802 --> 00:43:15.871
Take your shot, come on.

729
00:43:15.905 --> 00:43:18.040
Come on. You've been
babysitting all night.

730
00:43:18.073 --> 00:43:19.808
Come on, David.

731
00:43:19.842 --> 00:43:21.744
- Fuck him.
- Alright, fuck it, whatever.

732
00:43:25.347 --> 00:43:28.717
Hey, what's up, Johnny Cash?

733
00:43:28.751 --> 00:43:30.186
What? You're trying to be
all cool over there

734
00:43:30.219 --> 00:43:32.121
to impress your little
lady friend and shit?

735
00:43:32.154 --> 00:43:33.856
Come take a shot with us.

736
00:43:33.889 --> 00:43:35.824
Come on.
This is some bomb-ass tequila.

737
00:43:35.858 --> 00:43:37.459
Hey don't get him
fucking drunk, dude.

738
00:43:37.493 --> 00:43:40.429
Just one shot. One.

739
00:43:40.462 --> 00:43:42.498
Hey, Creeper, I've seen
your ass drunk, fool.

740
00:43:42.531 --> 00:43:44.500
You cry like a little bitch
and shit.

741
00:43:44.533 --> 00:43:46.502
I've been nothing
but a gentleman to you.

742
00:43:46.535 --> 00:43:48.370
How many fucking favors
have I done for you?

743
00:43:48.404 --> 00:43:50.506
- How many? A lot, a lot.
- Oh, yeah, tons of favors.

744
00:43:50.539 --> 00:43:52.041
Yeah, hold on,
let me count them.

745
00:43:52.074 --> 00:43:53.309
How about that time you gave me

746
00:43:53.342 --> 00:43:55.211
like three different STDs
and shit.

747
00:43:55.244 --> 00:43:56.478
Are you fucking kidding?

748
00:43:56.512 --> 00:43:58.781
Dude, did you fuck him
without a condom?

749
00:43:58.814 --> 00:44:01.951
- You're fucking nasty.
- She's kidding. She's fucking...

750
00:44:01.984 --> 00:44:04.119
I have a bunch of condoms.
You're going to need them.

751
00:44:04.153 --> 00:44:05.888
I tell you what, you go out
to the parking lot

752
00:44:05.921 --> 00:44:07.256
and your car's on fire,
now you know why.

753
00:44:07.289 --> 00:44:08.958
Oh, now I know why
my car's on fire.

754
00:44:08.991 --> 00:44:11.894
Hey, Creeper, I Ubered here.

755
00:44:15.998 --> 00:44:17.967
Hold that shit, though.
Pass that shit out.

756
00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.969
Hey, hey, no, no.
You're not fucking smoking weed

757
00:44:20.002 --> 00:44:22.871
in my backyard
with Alexis right here.

758
00:44:22.905 --> 00:44:25.407
- No.
- Dude, come on.

759
00:44:25.441 --> 00:44:27.109
She used to be cool as fuck.

760
00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:32.314
I know what it is.

761
00:44:35.184 --> 00:44:37.119
You talked to Dad?

762
00:44:37.152 --> 00:44:38.220
No.

763
00:44:38.254 --> 00:44:40.956
No? Since when no?

764
00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:43.559
Just no. Okay?

765
00:44:43.593 --> 00:44:44.994
He don't want to talk to me.

766
00:44:45.027 --> 00:44:48.297
Think he cares
what I have to say?

767
00:44:48.330 --> 00:44:52.334
Hey, Dad's version of being
a dad is opposite day.

768
00:44:55.605 --> 00:44:58.173
Hey.

769
00:44:58.207 --> 00:44:59.942
Sorry.

770
00:45:21.263 --> 00:45:23.132
Dance with me.

771
00:46:26.663 --> 00:46:28.665
David, I'm going to take care

772
00:46:28.698 --> 00:46:30.265
of that thing that
we talked about, okay?

773
00:46:30.299 --> 00:46:32.434
It's all good.
When I'm done with Conejo,

774
00:46:32.468 --> 00:46:35.270
he's going to wish he stayed
in Mexico selling fucking tacos.

775
00:46:40.943 --> 00:46:43.278
Hey, Conejo's getting
his ass aired out.

776
00:46:52.689 --> 00:46:56.492
I want what you got
with Alexis.

777
00:46:56.525 --> 00:46:58.293
You got your wife,
you've got your kids,

778
00:46:58.327 --> 00:47:00.195
you've got your castle.

779
00:47:00.229 --> 00:47:01.930
You go out there,
you come back here,

780
00:47:01.964 --> 00:47:04.433
you're fucking safe
behind these walls.

781
00:47:04.466 --> 00:47:07.302
Fuck. I'm always living
my life on point.

782
00:47:07.336 --> 00:47:10.072
You know, I'm always watching
for the fucking bullet.

783
00:47:12.642 --> 00:47:14.510
I love my family.

784
00:47:14.543 --> 00:47:16.211
I love God.

785
00:47:16.245 --> 00:47:18.280
Oh, fuck me.

786
00:47:18.313 --> 00:47:20.015
God allows me to walk
through darkness

787
00:47:20.048 --> 00:47:23.419
and come back into the light.

788
00:47:23.452 --> 00:47:25.154
I have two worlds.

789
00:47:25.187 --> 00:47:27.556
You can too.

790
00:47:27.590 --> 00:47:29.258
You think God's
going to have me, fool?

791
00:47:29.291 --> 00:47:31.360
- He will.
- Mm-hmm.

792
00:47:31.393 --> 00:47:33.228
God doesn't exist.

793
00:47:33.262 --> 00:47:35.665
I'm a product
of evolution, David.

794
00:47:35.698 --> 00:47:37.199
I'm supposed to
terrorize the herd.

795
00:47:37.232 --> 00:47:38.434
That's my function.

796
00:47:38.467 --> 00:47:39.702
That's the knowledge
I was born with.

797
00:47:39.736 --> 00:47:41.336
Don't say that.

798
00:47:41.370 --> 00:47:43.405
You know, I've seen
so many motherfuckers die.

799
00:47:43.439 --> 00:47:45.574
So many.
And when the lights go out,

800
00:47:45.608 --> 00:47:47.342
it's just a fucking pile
of meat left.

801
00:47:47.376 --> 00:47:49.411
That's it.

802
00:47:49.445 --> 00:47:52.649
So I know when I die, I die.
That's the end of the book.

803
00:47:52.682 --> 00:47:54.450
I see so many
motherfuckers begging,

804
00:47:54.483 --> 00:47:57.654
pissing, shitting themselves for
one more fucking second of life,

805
00:47:57.687 --> 00:47:59.321
and when I'm there
pulling their card,

806
00:47:59.354 --> 00:48:02.157
I'm their God when I'm there.

807
00:48:05.527 --> 00:48:08.397
When I'm there, I'm God.

808
00:48:08.430 --> 00:48:10.132
Nice house.

809
00:48:10.165 --> 00:48:12.167
What the fuck
is she doing here?

810
00:48:12.201 --> 00:48:16.205
The fuck are you doing here?

811
00:48:16.238 --> 00:48:18.140
Be too bad if somebody
firebombed it

812
00:48:18.173 --> 00:48:21.276
and killed
all these fucking people.

813
00:48:21.310 --> 00:48:23.145
Bitch,
I'll cut your fucking legs off.

814
00:48:23.178 --> 00:48:25.080
Don't you check
your fucking phone?

815
00:48:28.585 --> 00:48:32.354
Your uncle wants you
to sit down with Conejo.

816
00:48:32.387 --> 00:48:34.657
Says we have to make it right.

817
00:48:34.691 --> 00:48:36.525
Fuck you.

818
00:48:36.558 --> 00:48:39.461
You come into my fucking house.
Why the fuck should I trust you?

819
00:48:39.495 --> 00:48:43.733
Baby.

820
00:48:43.766 --> 00:48:46.568
Better fucking hurry.

821
00:48:52.207 --> 00:48:53.509
Wow.

822
00:48:53.542 --> 00:48:56.211
Hey, fool,
that's like the female you.

823
00:48:56.245 --> 00:49:00.349
You guys should get married
and have evil babies and shit.

824
00:49:00.382 --> 00:49:03.118
I ain't going to lie, my boy,
I'm intrigued as fuck.

825
00:49:39.542 --> 00:49:42.000
Did you think
about what we talked about?

826
00:49:41.791 --> 00:49:44.426
Where's my uncle at?

827
00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:48.167
Your uncle's been
in this business a long time.

828
00:49:48.208 --> 00:49:50.542
He talks a lot about the past...

829
00:49:50.625 --> 00:49:54.458
...and forgets that we have
a lot of product to move.

830
00:49:54.737 --> 00:49:57.339
The real decisions
are made far from here.

831
00:49:57.458 --> 00:49:58.958
But, have you asked yourself:

832
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.708
Why are you only breaking arms
for Wizard?

833
00:50:02.708 --> 00:50:04.792
It's nice to have
a powerful family...

834
00:50:04.833 --> 00:50:08.208
...and royal blood
running through your veins.

835
00:50:08.292 --> 00:50:09.750
Blood protects blood.

836
00:50:10.252 --> 00:50:13.188
I'm not going to sit here and
listen to a fucking TED Talk.

837
00:50:13.221 --> 00:50:15.190
I was told that
my uncle was here.

838
00:50:15.223 --> 00:50:16.659
So where the fuck is he?

839
00:50:16.693 --> 00:50:20.830
See, when you kill a man
and you don't kill his sons,

840
00:50:20.863 --> 00:50:22.531
this is what happens.

841
00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.667
The trigger was pulled
years ago.

842
00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:28.805
Sometimes it take a minute for
that bullet to hit its target.

843
00:50:30.250 --> 00:50:32.542
Gata, show them.

844
00:50:54.396 --> 00:50:55.832
Just following orders.

845
00:50:55.865 --> 00:50:58.433
I want you to understand
that I'm not a threat to you.

846
00:50:58.467 --> 00:51:00.903
As a matter of fact,
I'm the only hope you got.

847
00:51:00.937 --> 00:51:02.639
¿Palabra?

848
00:51:02.672 --> 00:51:05.474
You actually thought
that your uncle could help you.

849
00:51:05.507 --> 00:51:08.945
Nah, little homey,
only you could do that.

850
00:51:08.978 --> 00:51:11.581
For how many years have they
promised to open up the books,

851
00:51:11.614 --> 00:51:14.516
have you made into a boss
in the organization?

852
00:51:14.250 --> 00:51:19.667
Now Wizard's time is over,
and your world is dying.

853
00:51:19.708 --> 00:51:22.375
If you want to join me,
you're welcome to...

854
00:51:22.458 --> 00:51:24.917
...because you do your job well.

855
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:25.833
I can take care of you...

856
00:51:25.875 --> 00:51:29.667
...and make you richer
than you ever imagined.

857
00:51:29.564 --> 00:51:32.835
All you got to do is kiss
the ring and join the family

858
00:51:32.869 --> 00:51:34.671
and I'll give you something
that your uncle

859
00:51:34.704 --> 00:51:37.339
and Wizard have kept from you
all this time.

860
00:51:37.372 --> 00:51:40.208
If Wizard wanted to,
he could give you more power

861
00:51:40.242 --> 00:51:42.879
than you could handle
with just a nod.

862
00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:47.667
But Wizard doesn't talk to you,
does he?

863
00:51:54.456 --> 00:51:57.627
♪ Nothing to see, babe

864
00:51:57.660 --> 00:52:00.763
♪ When the lights are on

865
00:52:13.609 --> 00:52:15.845
You said we were protected.

866
00:52:15.878 --> 00:52:21.316
You knew who I was
and what my family was.

867
00:52:21.349 --> 00:52:22.852
Should we run?

868
00:52:22.885 --> 00:52:26.321
There's nowhere to run,
and they'd find us.

869
00:52:31.359 --> 00:52:34.262
I'm sorry I'm scared.
The kids...

870
00:52:34.296 --> 00:52:37.700
Alexis, these are international
players worth billions,

871
00:52:37.734 --> 00:52:42.038
and Wizard and Conejo
are fighting it out right now.

872
00:52:42.071 --> 00:52:44.974
I got my small slice
of the game.

873
00:52:45.007 --> 00:52:46.876
They're way up there.

874
00:52:46.909 --> 00:52:48.945
And I'm down here.

875
00:52:48.978 --> 00:52:50.880
And I ain't shit.

876
00:52:54.951 --> 00:52:59.956
We can't join them,
we can't run, what's left?

877
00:52:59.989 --> 00:53:01.691
I want to fight him.

878
00:53:05.494 --> 00:53:06.896
Okay.

879
00:53:06.929 --> 00:53:08.330
I trust you.

880
00:53:08.363 --> 00:53:09.832
I can't surrender to Conejo.

881
00:53:13.401 --> 00:53:17.673
He's demonic, and I feel it.

882
00:53:17.707 --> 00:53:18.941
Tell me what to do.

883
00:53:18.975 --> 00:53:21.343
Don't change a thing.

884
00:53:21.376 --> 00:53:24.847
Conejo's watching you.

885
00:53:24.881 --> 00:53:26.381
They won't see it coming.

886
00:53:30.452 --> 00:53:32.855
He worked on the number-two guy
in Jalisco.

887
00:53:32.889 --> 00:53:34.456
He's got someone in T.J.

888
00:53:34.489 --> 00:53:36.759
Get him anything
he wants at anyway to San Diego.

889
00:53:36.793 --> 00:53:38.594
He's probably got
a fucking tunnel.

890
00:53:38.628 --> 00:53:40.963
It seems like it, so he can just
clip killers for his mission.

891
00:53:40.997 --> 00:53:42.564
Is no one concerned
his uncle's head

892
00:53:42.598 --> 00:53:44.100
was in a fucking beer cooler?

893
00:53:44.133 --> 00:53:47.603
Where's Wizard in all of this?

894
00:53:47.637 --> 00:53:49.538
I mean, we could use the
high-powered help right now.

895
00:53:49.571 --> 00:53:52.407
I need you to find me this lame
motherfucker so I can kill him.

896
00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:53.743
I'm working on
his location.

897
00:53:53.776 --> 00:53:55.377
Well, work harder.

898
00:53:55.410 --> 00:53:57.546
The guy's streetcraft
is bulletproof, alright?

899
00:53:57.580 --> 00:53:59.582
He sleeps in hotels,
different apartments.

900
00:53:59.615 --> 00:54:01.050
Doesn't trust anyone,
always on the move

901
00:54:01.083 --> 00:54:03.619
so no one knows where he's going
to be hour to hour.

902
00:54:03.653 --> 00:54:05.955
Look, he rolls with a couple
of rock star shooters.

903
00:54:05.988 --> 00:54:07.657
One guy's up from
the Marine Corps Special Forces.

904
00:54:07.690 --> 00:54:08.891
The other one's
a former lieutenant

905
00:54:08.925 --> 00:54:10.358
in the federal
Mexican SWAT team.

906
00:54:10.392 --> 00:54:11.861
Wow.

907
00:54:11.894 --> 00:54:14.396
They're players,
and they got heavy weapons.

908
00:54:14.429 --> 00:54:17.566
Are we not going to talk about
the elephant in the room, David?

909
00:54:19.769 --> 00:54:21.637
Is Wizard next?

910
00:54:21.671 --> 00:54:23.005
Shut the fuck up.

911
00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:32.014
David, get your family
and get the fuck out of LA

912
00:54:32.048 --> 00:54:33.983
until we handle this for you.

913
00:54:34.016 --> 00:54:35.918
No.

914
00:54:35.952 --> 00:54:40.022
Nobody's untouchable.

915
00:54:40.056 --> 00:54:41.958
If it's about money,
we have money for you.

916
00:54:41.991 --> 00:54:44.894
- Yeah sure, it'll help.
- Okay.

917
00:54:44.927 --> 00:54:48.164
But we can do this.
We just need some time.

918
00:54:48.197 --> 00:54:49.732
Maybe a few weeks.

919
00:54:49.765 --> 00:54:50.700
Hey.

920
00:54:52.869 --> 00:54:54.804
You got some of the best
fucking soldados

921
00:54:54.837 --> 00:54:57.572
in the game right here.

922
00:54:57.607 --> 00:54:59.842
Look around, my boy.

923
00:54:59.876 --> 00:55:01.777
Every single one of these
motherfuckers will ride with you

924
00:55:01.811 --> 00:55:03.646
till the wheels fall off.

925
00:55:03.679 --> 00:55:05.114
Now I'm going to hit Conejo,

926
00:55:05.147 --> 00:55:07.482
and I'm going to keep hitting
until one of us is dead,

927
00:55:07.515 --> 00:55:11.187
and so will he, and so will he,
and this sick fuck right here,

928
00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:12.989
you don't think he wants
to spill blood, David?

929
00:55:13.022 --> 00:55:15.591
These are fucking riders, David.

930
00:55:15.625 --> 00:55:18.160
We got you.
Let us do this now.

931
00:55:33.109 --> 00:55:36.779
Okay.

932
00:55:36.812 --> 00:55:38.546
Let's go.

933
00:55:45.655 --> 00:55:48.456
Bang bang.

934
00:55:48.490 --> 00:55:50.593
Conejo's definitely
connected to the cartel.

935
00:55:50.626 --> 00:55:52.228
Plus they give zero fucks.

936
00:55:52.261 --> 00:55:54.496
I mean, this guy has the power

937
00:55:54.529 --> 00:55:56.032
to turn out the entire game
up here.

938
00:55:56.065 --> 00:55:57.867
I need you tell me
how to get to

939
00:55:57.900 --> 00:55:59.835
this lame motherfucker,
that's what I need from you.

940
00:55:59.869 --> 00:56:01.503
I just need some time.

941
00:56:17.987 --> 00:56:21.624
You've got a millionaire
and a stone pillar.

942
00:56:36.238 --> 00:56:37.940
- Fuck!
- Fuck!

943
00:56:45.281 --> 00:56:46.949
Run, run!

944
00:57:11.167 --> 00:57:13.625
I'm here to prepare for war.

945
00:57:13.667 --> 00:57:16.500
Protect me from the bullets
of my enemies.

946
00:57:26.917 --> 00:57:29.708
Make me invisible
to the government's eyes.

947
00:57:29.792 --> 00:57:31.500
Make my heart strong...

948
00:57:31.542 --> 00:57:33.667
...because I'm here
to take it all.

949
00:57:55.017 --> 00:57:56.118
Hey.

950
00:57:56.250 --> 00:57:58.625
Move, let's get
what we came for.

951
00:58:00.583 --> 00:58:03.458
Gata, bring her to me.

952
00:58:13.667 --> 00:58:16.042
Let's get this over with...

953
00:58:16.125 --> 00:58:18.667
...and send these motherfuckers
to hell.

954
00:59:02.917 --> 00:59:05.583
You'll beg
for a bullet in the head.

955
00:59:05.187 --> 00:59:07.089
But I ain't going
to give you nothing but pain.

956
00:59:07.250 --> 00:59:09.083
Primo, bring him.

957
00:59:12.128 --> 00:59:13.729
Hey, puto.

958
00:59:17.167 --> 00:59:18.750
We'll throw this bitch a party.

959
00:59:58.207 --> 01:00:02.945
I'm going to need
some copies of that ASAP.

960
01:00:02.978 --> 01:00:06.182
Okay. I'm sorry.

961
01:00:06.215 --> 01:00:08.017
What's going on?
What happened to you?

962
01:00:11.987 --> 01:00:13.422
Tell me what's going on.

963
01:00:13.455 --> 01:00:15.157
Just drive, Alexis.
Drive the fucking car, okay?

964
01:00:15.191 --> 01:00:16.492
Okay, okay, baby,
your face is all bloody.

965
01:00:16.525 --> 01:00:18.260
Stop.
Just get the kids, okay?

966
01:00:18.294 --> 01:00:19.428
- I am, David.
- Get the fucking kids.

967
01:00:19.461 --> 01:00:20.896
Stop fucking touching me
already.

968
01:00:20.930 --> 01:00:22.831
I'm trying to keep calm,
but I'm scared.

969
01:00:22.865 --> 01:00:24.066
- Tell me what's happening.
- Okay, good, good.

970
01:00:24.099 --> 01:00:26.135
Be scared.
Be very fucking scared.

971
01:00:26.168 --> 01:00:27.736
Run the fucking light.
Don't stop.

972
01:00:27.770 --> 01:00:29.271
What? No, I'm not going to
run the red light.

973
01:00:29.305 --> 01:00:33.042
There's a cop behind us, David.
There's a cop behind us.

974
01:00:33.075 --> 01:00:35.177
Just fucking drive perfectly,
okay?

975
01:00:37.513 --> 01:00:39.014
Oh, my God.
He's got lights on, David.

976
01:00:39.048 --> 01:00:40.182
- He's gonna pull us over.
- What?

977
01:00:40.216 --> 01:00:41.517
- He's gonna pull us over.
- No, he's not. No, he's not.

978
01:00:41.550 --> 01:00:42.785
- Just calm down.
- Shit. Shit.

979
01:00:42.818 --> 01:00:44.954
Just calm.

980
01:00:50.993 --> 01:00:52.394
What's going on?

981
01:00:52.428 --> 01:00:54.163
A real man knows
when to take a knee

982
01:00:54.196 --> 01:00:55.965
and serve the stronger master.

983
01:00:55.998 --> 01:00:57.499
Fuck you, you motherfucker.

984
01:00:57.533 --> 01:00:59.902
The difference between
a king and a servant,

985
01:00:59.935 --> 01:01:04.173
the servant acts while the king
masterminds the whole shit.

986
01:01:04.206 --> 01:01:07.509
I got your boy.
He's alive.

987
01:01:07.543 --> 01:01:10.246
- Is that Creeper?
- Come swoop him up.

988
01:01:10.279 --> 01:01:12.147
His dog ass right here
crying for you.

989
01:01:12.181 --> 01:01:14.416
Fuck you,
you fucking piece of shit.

990
01:01:14.450 --> 01:01:16.085
Fuck you.

991
01:01:16.118 --> 01:01:18.387
Creeper, it's alright, man.
You're going to be okay.

992
01:01:18.420 --> 01:01:21.090
I came as a friend
and I offered you life.

993
01:01:21.123 --> 01:01:23.125
Now I come as an enemy
and bring you death.

994
01:01:23.158 --> 01:01:26.061
Motherfucker, fuck you,
you fucking bitch.

995
01:01:26.095 --> 01:01:29.832
The fuck you doing with that,
you stupid fucking bitch?

996
01:01:29.865 --> 01:01:31.567
Leave him alone,
you stupid piece of shit!

997
01:01:31.601 --> 01:01:33.836
What's going on?

998
01:01:36.939 --> 01:01:38.907
- Hey, leave him alone!
- Oh, my God.

999
01:01:38.941 --> 01:01:40.943
Let him go, you motherfucker.

1000
01:01:45.147 --> 01:01:46.448
Let him go, motherfucker!

1001
01:01:46.482 --> 01:01:48.951
Leave him alone,
you fucking coward!

1002
01:01:48.984 --> 01:01:51.520
Don't curse me.
This is your truth.

1003
01:01:51.553 --> 01:01:53.155
Your pride cost this.

1004
01:01:53.188 --> 01:01:55.491
I was sent here on a mission
by the real jefes

1005
01:01:55.524 --> 01:01:57.426
to flip the whole
fucking game over.

1006
01:01:57.459 --> 01:01:59.094
Alright, motherfucker,
you fucking made

1007
01:01:59.128 --> 01:02:00.429
your fucking point, homey.

1008
01:02:00.462 --> 01:02:01.930
Leave him alone, motherfucker.

1009
01:02:01.964 --> 01:02:03.499
You want a little kindness
for your friend?

1010
01:02:03.532 --> 01:02:07.002
Mercy? Watch.
Watch my mercy.

1011
01:02:07.036 --> 01:02:09.104
Fuck you.

1012
01:02:09.138 --> 01:02:10.372
You're a shit bitch.

1013
01:02:13.108 --> 01:02:14.376
Hey!

1014
01:02:24.887 --> 01:02:27.590
Everything you love
is going to die real bad.

1015
01:02:42.605 --> 01:02:48.243
Dylan.
Hey. Hey, hey, baby.

1016
01:02:48.277 --> 01:02:50.446
We got to go, okay?

1017
01:02:54.249 --> 01:02:55.451
Baby, we need to go right now.

1018
01:02:55.484 --> 01:02:59.388
- But I'm...
- Leave it. Come on.

1019
01:02:59.421 --> 01:03:01.890
Baby, come on.
Come on.

1020
01:03:11.467 --> 01:03:13.168
Favvy was heading back north
but she's turning around.

1021
01:03:13.202 --> 01:03:14.336
She's going to pick up the kids

1022
01:03:14.370 --> 01:03:15.537
and take them to Fresno
with her.

1023
01:03:15.571 --> 01:03:16.972
Go with.

1024
01:03:17.005 --> 01:03:18.540
No.
No, I am not leaving you.

1025
01:03:18.574 --> 01:03:21.343
- Alexis, I'm not asking you.
- Yeah, well, neither am I.

1026
01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:25.481
Stay here while I go
get the money.

1027
01:03:28.183 --> 01:03:30.620
I'll stay here.

1028
01:03:30.653 --> 01:03:32.921
Listen.

1029
01:03:32.955 --> 01:03:34.691
We're on our own.

1030
01:03:34.724 --> 01:03:37.359
You don't believe that.

1031
01:03:37.393 --> 01:03:39.528
I don't need to.

1032
01:03:39.561 --> 01:03:40.896
I know it.

1033
01:03:48.337 --> 01:03:51.173
David, prom... promise me

1034
01:03:51.206 --> 01:03:53.208
that we're going to
start over, please.

1035
01:03:59.749 --> 01:04:03.485
Okay?

1036
01:04:03.519 --> 01:04:05.087
Start over.

1037
01:04:16.999 --> 01:04:20.235
Daddy, why do you have a gun?

1038
01:04:54.470 --> 01:05:00.042
Give us this day
our daily bread

1039
01:05:00.075 --> 01:05:02.377
and forgive us our trespasses,

1040
01:05:02.411 --> 01:05:05.314
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

1041
01:05:05.347 --> 01:05:07.449
Lead us not into temptation,

1042
01:05:07.483 --> 01:05:09.351
but deliver us from evil.

1043
01:05:09.384 --> 01:05:11.320
Amen.

1044
01:05:20.195 --> 01:05:21.698
Yo, what the fuck
is going on?

1045
01:05:21.731 --> 01:05:23.332
What the fuck is going on?

1046
01:05:23.365 --> 01:05:25.367
Hey, hey, stop, stop.
Calm the fuck down, okay?

1047
01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:28.270
Hey, if anyone asks, you
haven't fucking seen me, okay?

1048
01:05:28.303 --> 01:05:30.205
Man.

1049
01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:33.408
Oh, fuck.

1050
01:06:16.653 --> 01:06:19.689
Fuck.

1051
01:06:19.722 --> 01:06:21.189
How much is that?

1052
01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:27.129
Over a million and a half.

1053
01:06:30.465 --> 01:06:32.735
And that's been there
this whole time?

1054
01:06:32.769 --> 01:06:34.837
Nine years.

1055
01:06:34.871 --> 01:06:37.640
Me and Creeper robbed
an armored car back in the day.

1056
01:06:40.375 --> 01:06:42.679
Crazy.

1057
01:06:47.149 --> 01:06:49.484
You heated up, primo?

1058
01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:53.288
No.

1059
01:06:53.322 --> 01:06:55.324
Here.

1060
01:06:55.357 --> 01:06:57.459
It was your dad's.

1061
01:06:57.492 --> 01:06:59.829
It's got a lot of murders on it.

1062
01:07:01.931 --> 01:07:03.365
Take it.

1063
01:07:10.472 --> 01:07:11.908
You need me to ride with you?

1064
01:07:11.941 --> 01:07:13.776
You know I got your back.

1065
01:07:14.744 --> 01:07:16.445
No.

1066
01:07:47.242 --> 01:07:48.645

David, David, stop.
What are you doing, David?

1068
01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:52.347
I know exactly
what the fuck I'm doing.

1069
01:07:52.381 --> 01:07:54.449
- Oh, do you?
- Yeah.

1070
01:07:54.483 --> 01:07:56.786
Don't let it touch, Alexis.

1071
01:07:56.819 --> 01:07:58.320
She's clean.

1072
01:07:58.353 --> 01:08:00.355
Don't let the family business
touch her.

1073
01:08:00.389 --> 01:08:03.325

it will turn black.

Are the kids okay?

Uh, I don't have the kids.

1116
01:12:09.972 --> 01:12:11.807
Where are they?

1117
01:12:11.841 --> 01:12:14.010
Alexis texted saying
she was keeping them.

1125
01:13:06.629 --> 01:13:08.698
Fuck.

1126
01:13:08.731 --> 01:13:10.565
Fuck!

1127
01:13:10.599 --> 01:13:12.668
Fuck!

1128
01:13:33.956 --> 01:13:36.524
Hey.
Now I'm going to hit Conejo,

1129
01:13:36.558 --> 01:13:39.527
and I'm going to keep hitting
until one of us is dead.

1130
01:13:45.701 --> 01:13:47.903
I'd die for you, my boy.

1131
01:13:47.937 --> 01:13:49.638
Let's go.

1132
01:14:27.243 --> 01:14:29.178
Blood, you can't come in.

1133
01:14:29.211 --> 01:14:32.181
Then tell Bone that Capone
from the cutdowns is right here.

1134
01:14:43.826 --> 01:14:45.227
Bone.

1135
01:14:45.261 --> 01:14:47.296
Blood out here
name dropping on you.

1136
01:14:50.232 --> 01:14:51.934
Hey, y'all, give us a second.

1137
01:14:51.967 --> 01:14:55.971
This might be above
y'all pay grade.

1138
01:14:56.005 --> 01:14:57.740
Now clear it out for me.

1139
01:15:00.142 --> 01:15:01.744
Where's your crew?
Why you by yourself?

1140
01:15:01.777 --> 01:15:05.047
- Everybody's gone, man.
- What you mean, gone?

1141
01:15:05.081 --> 01:15:06.282
Why are you here, bro?

1142
01:15:06.315 --> 01:15:08.017
They killed my wife.

1143
01:15:08.050 --> 01:15:10.019
And they killed Creeper, man.

1144
01:15:10.052 --> 01:15:12.154
Mexico's trying to
change the structure.

1145
01:15:12.188 --> 01:15:14.990
They took my kids, man.
They took my kids.

1146
01:15:15.024 --> 01:15:17.660
- What you need?
- I need riders with heart.

1147
01:15:17.693 --> 01:15:19.962
Some motherfucking killers
with choppers, Bone.

1148
01:15:19.995 --> 01:15:21.997
I'm alone, Bone, I'm trying
to do this shit by myself,

1149
01:15:22.031 --> 01:15:23.299
but I ain't got
nobody else, man.

1150
01:15:23.332 --> 01:15:24.800
- Listen, we, I'm...
- I need your help.

1151
01:15:24.834 --> 01:15:27.036
I'm with you, bro. I'm with you.

1152
01:15:27.069 --> 01:15:29.238
- Thumper, we fucking with Blood.
- That's right.

1153
01:15:29.271 --> 01:15:30.973
This is a good motherfucker
here, man.

1154
01:15:31.006 --> 01:15:33.008
- That's right.
- I told you he was a candle.

1155
01:15:33.042 --> 01:15:34.877
- We fucking with you.
- That's right.

1156
01:15:38.848 --> 01:15:43.085
So I'm not saying we're
a bunch of scandalous niggas

1157
01:15:43.119 --> 01:15:47.156
with fucked-up pasts,

1158
01:15:47.189 --> 01:15:51.827
but we got a chance to wash
all our sins away on this one.

1159
01:15:51.861 --> 01:15:54.663
That's a good man, right there.

1160
01:15:54.697 --> 01:15:57.066
He stands for what we stand for.

1161
01:15:57.099 --> 01:16:00.903
And somebody done
took his fucking kids.

1162
01:16:00.936 --> 01:16:03.772
I'm not politicking,
pushing the line,

1163
01:16:03.806 --> 01:16:06.208
shot calling,
none of that bullshit,

1164
01:16:06.242 --> 01:16:10.079
but we going so far down
the rabbit hole on this one,

1165
01:16:10.112 --> 01:16:12.314
there might not be
no getting back.

1166
01:16:12.348 --> 01:16:16.719
This is strictly
a volunteer mission.

1167
01:16:16.752 --> 01:16:20.256
'Cause this shit
is heavy as it gets.

1168
01:16:20.289 --> 01:16:23.993
And I ain't never asked y'all to
do nothing that I wouldn't do.

1169
01:16:24.026 --> 01:16:25.995
I'm with the bullshit.

1170
01:16:26.028 --> 01:16:27.229
I'm ready. Fuck it. It's on.

1171
01:16:27.263 --> 01:16:29.198
- Let's go on, man.
- Feel?

1172
01:16:29.231 --> 01:16:30.799
Pablos is on.

1173
01:16:30.833 --> 01:16:33.102
Okay, five. What are we doing?

1174
01:16:33.135 --> 01:16:35.371
We're going to get
his kids, homey.

1175
01:16:35.404 --> 01:16:38.807
On Pablo Bishops,
we fucking with you.

1176
01:16:38.841 --> 01:16:40.409
So let's do it.

1177
01:16:40.442 --> 01:16:43.112
Got you.

1178
01:17:30.159 --> 01:17:33.128
Stupid motherfuckers should
have kept your ass in Mexico.

1179
01:17:33.162 --> 01:17:34.263
Hey.

1180
01:17:37.833 --> 01:17:40.469
Where are my kids at, huh?

1181
01:17:40.502 --> 01:17:43.372
- See if you fucking remember.
- Throw his fucking ass out.

1182
01:17:50.913 --> 01:17:52.414
Where are my kids at, que?

1183
01:17:52.448 --> 01:17:54.016
I really don't know.
My messages on my phone.

1184
01:17:55.818 --> 01:17:57.186
Unlock the fucking phone.

1185
01:17:57.219 --> 01:18:01.090
- Unlock it.
- Unlock that shit.

1186
01:18:01.123 --> 01:18:03.158
Fucker.

1187
01:18:03.192 --> 01:18:05.894
Here's the address on the phone.

1188
01:18:05.928 --> 01:18:08.097
Let's go get your kids.

1189
01:18:08.130 --> 01:18:09.832
We're going to get
your kids, man.

1190
01:18:33.088 --> 01:18:34.857
Go, go!

1191
01:18:34.890 --> 01:18:37.226
- Honey!
- Check the back.

1192
01:18:45.134 --> 01:18:47.169
Ain't no body back here
but Conejo's grandma.

1193
01:18:47.202 --> 01:18:49.505
- Clear.
- It's all clear, Dave.

1194
01:18:49.538 --> 01:18:51.006
Nobody up in here.

1195
01:18:53.542 --> 01:18:56.011
Where's Mommy?

1196
01:18:56.045 --> 01:18:58.480
She's not here right now.

1197
01:18:58.514 --> 01:19:00.449
I'm here.

1198
01:19:00.482 --> 01:19:03.152
Dave, how are we
going to do her?

1199
01:19:06.889 --> 01:19:08.824
I ain't going down to his level.

1200
01:19:11.427 --> 01:19:13.462
- Okay.
- Family's sacred.

1201
01:19:18.833 --> 01:19:20.500
Conejo...

1202
01:19:20.583 --> 01:19:22.750
I know where he is.

1203
01:19:26.676 --> 01:19:28.277
You guys go with them, okay?

1204
01:19:28.310 --> 01:19:31.113
Y'all take care
of the man's kids.

1205
01:19:31.146 --> 01:19:34.049
And on my life,
they're going to be safe.

1206
01:19:36.452 --> 01:19:38.588
- I'm going with you.
- No.

1207
01:19:38.621 --> 01:19:40.255
I got to do this alone.

1208
01:19:40.289 --> 01:19:42.324
No, you're not alone tonight.

1209
01:19:42.358 --> 01:19:47.930
This is me and you till
the fucking wheels fall off.

1210
01:19:47.963 --> 01:19:49.465
It's like that.

1211
01:20:02.111 --> 01:20:04.079
That's the house right there.

1212
01:20:04.113 --> 01:20:06.115
That's Conejo's eyes outside.

1213
01:20:06.148 --> 01:20:09.619
The motherfucker
has a chopper in his hand.

1214
01:21:08.510 --> 01:21:10.345
Yeah, that's right, keep coming,
keep coming.

1215
01:21:10.379 --> 01:21:12.314
I'mma dome
your motherfucking ass.

1216
01:21:15.417 --> 01:21:17.119
Drop it.

1217
01:21:19.555 --> 01:21:21.591
Come on.

1218
01:21:30.065 --> 01:21:31.701
Walk.

1219
01:24:03.620 --> 01:24:04.887
Motherfucker.

1220
01:24:04.921 --> 01:24:07.624
Get the fuck over here, bitch.

1221
01:24:12.708 --> 01:24:15.042
You're going to die.

1222
01:24:14.931 --> 01:24:18.200
All you had to do was say yes,
you stupid motherfucker.

1223
01:24:18.233 --> 01:24:20.569
You caused this.

1224
01:24:20.603 --> 01:24:24.406
Three, two, one, dead.

1225
01:24:27.476 --> 01:24:30.278
Don't defend what's gonna happen
right... right now.

1226
01:24:33.042 --> 01:24:36.833
Don't you know I have
the protection of the devil?

1227
01:24:36.418 --> 01:24:38.487
And your crowd ain't shit.

1228
01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:40.355
Just a badass bitch.

1229
01:24:56.606 --> 01:24:58.808
Think.

1230
01:25:30.583 --> 01:25:32.708
For my family, I live.

1231
01:25:36.083 --> 01:25:38.667
For my family, I die.

1232
01:25:41.542 --> 01:25:43.250
For my family...

1233
01:25:43.333 --> 01:25:45.083
...I kill.

1234
01:26:14.984 --> 01:26:17.620
It's me, it's me, it's me.

1235
01:26:17.653 --> 01:26:19.488
Come on,
we got to get out of here.

1236
01:26:19.521 --> 01:26:21.389
We got to get out of here.
Come on.

1237
01:26:35.972 --> 01:26:38.074
Taking you to see
my little homegirl.

1238
01:26:38.107 --> 01:26:41.343
She works at USC Medical Center,
patch you up.

1239
01:26:41.376 --> 01:26:42.912
No questions asked.

1240
01:26:51.020 --> 01:26:53.823
Pull over.
I got to talk to someone.

1241
01:27:29.058 --> 01:27:31.426
Talk to me.

1242
01:27:31.459 --> 01:27:33.696
Fucking talk to me.

1243
01:27:33.729 --> 01:27:38.366
Congratulations.
You did it.

1244
01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:41.804
There were two,
and now there is one.

1245
01:27:41.838 --> 01:27:43.606
How do you know?

1246
01:27:43.639 --> 01:27:46.441
I got the devil on my shoulder
here whispering in my ear.

1247
01:27:48.510 --> 01:27:51.647
It came for you and you beat it.

1248
01:27:51.681 --> 01:27:53.515
Just like I did in my day.

1249
01:27:55.818 --> 01:28:00.089
You saved me, mijo.
You saved me.

1250
01:28:05.761 --> 01:28:08.130
Now you can stand
under your own sky.

1251
01:28:11.033 --> 01:28:13.501
This pain you feel will go away.

1252
01:28:15.805 --> 01:28:18.540
But the power...

1253
01:28:18.573 --> 01:28:20.610
the power is forever.

1254
01:28:20.643 --> 01:28:24.013
I don't want that.
I want her.

1255
01:28:31.687 --> 01:28:36.692
Mijo, I love you.
My son.

1256
01:28:36.726 --> 01:28:38.127
Why are you saying that?

1257
01:28:40.196 --> 01:28:42.765
Why now?

1258
01:28:42.798 --> 01:28:45.768
You never said you loved me.

1259
01:28:45.801 --> 01:28:48.671
'Cause I didn't know
who you are.

1260
01:28:48.704 --> 01:28:50.740
Now I know.

1261
01:28:54.542 --> 01:28:58.748
You and me, we're the same.

1262
01:29:01.117 --> 01:29:04.954
You're a king.

1263
01:29:04.987 --> 01:29:06.889
I don't want it.

1264
01:29:09.158 --> 01:29:17.066
I don't want it, Dad.

1265
01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
But it wants you, son.

1266
01:29:17.099 --> 01:29:18.834
It wants you.

1267
01:29:22.805 --> 01:29:25.641
No.

1268
01:29:25.675 --> 01:29:28.543
No, I don't want that.

1269
01:30:04.313 --> 01:30:06.514
Forgive me.
